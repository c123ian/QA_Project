"Hi,I haven't used my PowerEdge T620 in a year or so. When I just turned it ON, it says:Configuring Memory....and that's it. Nothing happens. It has been doing this for 30 minutes now. I remember having done something like this over a year ago and it did the same thing. I believe I waited for hours and then turned it off. Anyhow, does anyone know what the problem could be? I have 64GB installed and maybe I can take out some memory sticks and see what happens. If that is a good idea, I would need to know in which slots I then have to plug in the memory. The manual is a bit funkt when wanting to use 32GB with 8GB sticks... Thanks..","Hi, what Joey means is that if you have a pc, another topic should be opened for it.

Hi All !Does anyone know of a Cuda PCIe 3.0 video card that will work in PowerEdge T330 and T430 server? Especially GeForce GTX 1080 Ti. I need it only for GPU coprocessor purposes.Thanks for any suggestions.Vlad..,"Hello.The T330 server does not support GPU cards. GeForce GTX 1080 Ti has not been tested and certified to function on the T430 server. It may(not) work.

"Hi,Since nothing is working on my T620 and its completely dead, I thought about checking if maybe the Front Panel is broken, and reseating the cables might do something. However, I cannot get the Panel out? I watched a video on how to do it, which is just loosening one screw, but that did not work for me. How do I get the dang thing out???Second question: If indeed my Motherboard is broken, wouldn't there still be power on the front panel? I mean, isn't that what the Panel is for, to tell you if and what is not working properly?Anything helps.Thanks..","Navissa, It could be a couple things, such as that your configuration may require removing the cooling fan assembly.

Normaly thats used for a point to point connection and not like a fabric.  A decade ago there was a SAS Switch made by LSI but that was never adopted by the big Vendors.This is not a FC HBA or a Network card so you cant use Brocade like FC SAN switches or similar.Regards,Joerg",
"I have a PowerEdge c6100 arriving soon.   It is a bottom end model with the Xeon 5520 processors. For the majority of what this server will be used for, that is more than enough. But for one blade the application in it will vastly benefit from a higher frequency rather than multi-cores. Doing a quick check I found that the 5520 is a socket 1366.  But when I check spec sheets for the server it mentions only the 5500 and 5600 series processors.  A little more digging shows that those 2 series were just factory options.   To my question: Is this server ~ONLY~ compatible with the 55/56 series processors or is it compatible with anything that fits the socket so to say?  Before I spend another grand on 2 CPUs with 3.4 Ghz I would like to know if they would work!~Thanks ahead of time, Tony.","Thanks for your question.

"Hi there,I've got a PowerEdge R320, great deal, £70 for an E5-2450, 48gb ram, dedicated enterprise iDRAC, both 350w PSU's and 3TB HDDs with a raid controller. However, I'm having lots of trouble when I'm running into updating the iDRAC firmware. I'm a bit of a neat freak so I'd really love everything to be as up-to-date as possible and I've gone through countless steps trying to fix this. Right now, It's on version 2.21.21. I haven't had any trouble updating the BIOS firmware but I have now rolled it back to its original 2.4.2 from having updated it to 2.9.0 . I have installed Windows Server 2012 R2 on it to try and get it to install from there but still no hope. I don't actually get that much of an error message when i do it, but its usually RED004. I've had a couple times where I've tried and the website comes up with iDRAC 8 instead of  iDRAC7. I have also tried hard resetting it with the command:racadm racreset hard -f Although this works to get iDRAC back into it's regular state after the firmware update going weird, trying again just gives similar errors and I have tried updating via the web page. This has been trying to upgrade to 2.30.30 and 2.65.65 I believe. Any help is much appreciated!.","Hi Joey,Today is the day it happened!I successfully updated the iDRAC firmware to 2.65.65.65 from 2.21.21.21.Firstly, I'd like to say thank you for your help in troubleshooting the situation and sticking with me throughout this nightmare.After having tried every method under the sun, iDRAC would still not update. Luckily, I found a great guy on YouTube (shoutout to him) going over his steps to fix a bricked iDRAC. Luckily, in my situation my iDRAC wasn't necessarily 'bricked'; iDRAC had no problem working even after the hundred failed firmware update attempts that I had tried. Although my situation wasn't exactly like his, the methods used to try and treat a bricked iDRAC managed to treat mine as well.So these are the steps I took to fix this problem (For an R320 or similar) Just to be said, I am not a qualified electrician. These are purely the steps I took to overcome this problem:You will need:USB UART device, one capable of 3.3v. (Cheap from Amazon)Soldering ironSD Card in the FAT format loaded with the firmware.d7 file in the root folder.iDRAC Enterprise cardSpare PC or Laptop with PuTTY installed.Make sure you export your iDRAC license. This can be done by the web GUI. If necessary also export you iDRAC settings as this will completely wipe all iDRAC configuration.On the motherboard there will be a BMC_UART port right next to the rear I/O of the MB. The connection pinout is: R320 (or similar) BMC_UARTFunctionPin 1 (Square Pad)Vdd (3.3v)Pin 2TxPin 3RxPin 4GNDSolder 4 jumper wires onto the board and connect them to the USB UART dongle as followed. Make sure the server is off!Connect to the serial port in PuTTY with your COM interface (if you're unsure what interface to use, check device manager) with a baudrate of 115200 using TELNET. Now you can boot the server. If those steps were successful, you should now see the uboot process of the server. If it has booted successfully, you should be greeted with a linux shell but in this situation we wont be needing that. Although it's a good idea to test your UART wiring so you are able to send text to the console.This next step can be a bit tricky. You now need a paperclip or anything else you can use to short a switch on the MB. The switch is located near the large silver heatsink, named SW2. To reboot the system, short switch 1. Now this is the tricky part - quickly switch over and short switch 2 while spamming any key in the console. If you are lucky, you will see the uboot process has been interrupted and you now have an iDRAC prompt. It will look something like: iDRAC 7/8=>With the FAT formatted SD card loaded with the fimware image, run: util recover -emmc -from sd -f firmimg.d7 -noreset -clean  If you are successful, it should have erased the EMMC and installed the new firmware. You can now unplug the server when it's safe to do so and drain the power by holding the power button down for 30 seconds. Unfortunately if you were unsuccessful, you may have a bad EMMC chip, I have read that these can go bad from perhaps too many write cycles.When booting up, you may or may not have the lifecycle controller telling you an update is required or spit out a firmware error. This is ok, just reboot the server a couple times and it should return to normal. Boot into the lifecycle controller and click 'about' in the top right corner. Voila! The iDRAC firmware should now be up-to-date! To restore the iDRAC license, go to the Platform Restore section and import the license. You will need a USB stick with your exported license on it. You can now unsolder the BMC_UART connection if you wish and uninstall the SD Card from the iDRAC Card.Here is a labelled photo of the MB to guide you: Here are the forums that helped me:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvSDNAi39YY&ab_channel=JunctionRunner https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/bsou3n/dell_r520_idrac_7_swc0700_and_idrac8_prompt/ https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/a49b4y/r720_idrac_help/ https://winraid.level1techs.com/t/problem-dell-r720xd-idrac-bios-recovery/32658/95 Many Thanks!","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvSDNAi39YY&ab_channel=JunctionRunner, https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/bsou3n/dell_r520_idrac_7_swc0700_and_idrac8_prompt/, https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/a49b4y/r720_idrac_help/, https://winraid.level1techs.com/t/problem-dell-r720xd-idrac-bios-recovery/32658/95"
"Hi,- T620 would get stuck on ""Configuring memory"" while booting. Never made it past that.- I then read about pressing ESC repeatedly while that message comes up and it actually worked.- Now my T620 would still show ""Configuring memory"" but after a minute it would say ""Configuring memory...Done"" and continue to boot.- It would now show a Memory Training Failure (RAM 1 and 3) while booting, but still boot. Only difference was that now I only had 48GB instead of 64GB, which made sense since my RAM is 8 x 8. - I was able to use the T620 just fine.- Installed a PCIe x 1 card into a PCIe x 16 (or is it x8?) slot and of course it would not work. The T620 would ""start"" but I would not see anything on the screen. I tried that twice and then took the PCIe x 1 card out again.- I switch RAM 1 with 2 and vice versa to see if the RAM is broken or the Motherboard.- Press the power button. Nothing. Took the power cable out, pressed for 10 seconds the power button, waited a minute, still nothing. The T620 makes no sound at all. ZERO. - Switched the RAM back the way it was, still nothing.- Checked the CMOS battery and it says 3 Volts, that it can't be that. I guess.At this point I have no idea why the T620 suddenly would not work anymore??? I heard no popping or smelled anything when plugging in the PCIe x 1 card because at the beginning I would that is what ""killed"" it. But I read online that people actually use PCIe x1 in x8 or x16 slots. So, no issue with that. I think.I only have one Power supply and its green light is on. What the heck would make the T620 stop working like that???Thanks..","Navissa,  I would start out with first draining the flea power by disconnecting AC power cables and then press and hold the power button for about 15 seconds, once you do that open the cover and take the server to its minimum to post configuration, that is removing everything internally and externallly from the server, including mouse and keyboard, except the following :System BoardCPU1 with heat sink (minimum for troubleshooting)Single DIMM configuration with DIMM in socket A1 (preferably not one previously erroring)Control Panel with cable (to power system on)PSU (and for redundant PSU also the PDB/PIB) After that power up and see if the no video issue is resolved. If so then add each of the removed devices back individually until the issue reappears, or all the devices are reinstalled without issue, this should help identify if there is a device causing the issue,Now if the system doesn't start under the minimum to post configuration, then it is one of the devices I listed above causing the issue. Let me know what you see.   DELL-Chris HSocial Media and Communities ProfessionalDell Technologies | Enterprise Support ServicesDid I answer your query?

We have a number of servers that have small, 1gb SD Cards, currently running ESXi 6.7  I have a bunch of kit that i need to keep going for a while until funded replacements are available.  I however, do need to update these to ESXi7.  I was looking at utilizing existing setup, however i need a minimum 8GB SD Card to be able to do this.I havent tested this yet (and will do) but i was wondering if there is the possibility of putting 2 different size cards into an IDSDM module, eg 1gb & 8GB and then mirror the 1GB > the 8GB to retain the setup, which could then be upgraded to ESXi 7 with the additional space.Any ideas? Thanks..",Just to advise that this has worked as i planned and effectively mirrored a 1gb SD card to a 64GB SD card through the IDSDM module.  All systems up and running.  Thanks.,
ihave bought this device and need connect between them with fiber channel but ineed non expensive solution as fiber card is very expensive.,"No, because you ask for a Fibre Channel HBA and i have postet all supportet Dell SKUs. Your card from a above is a Intel x520 SFP+ NETWORK CARD and work for Ethernet but not Fibre Channel.   The connector is optical for Fiber which looks identical but its not compatible.Regards,Joerg",
"The out of warranty 2018 PowerEdge T30 starts only when the BIST switch is kept pressed. Release the switch the machine turns off. Amber light blinks 2,2 in sequence..","Hi @joydeep70, To my assumption (without any documented information, I can't be sure), the BIST button completes the circuitry of the SMPS (PSU) and it manages to supply power to the mainboard. I would recommend trying replacing the PSU first. I won't rule out mainboard as the root cause. DELL-Joey CSocial Media and Communities ProfessionalDell Technologies | Enterprise Support ServicesDid I answer your query?

The system either needs to be booted into the LifeCycle controller or an OS so that a driver will load and the DRAC will see the drives. Check the DRAC Storage to see the drives. If it does not show then give the DRAC a reboot and check again. If it still does not show or as maintenance after they show, I'd recommend to check that the H310, BIOS and iDRAC are on latest firmware. Dell -Charles RSocial Media and Communities ProfessionalDell Technologies | Enterprise Support ServicesDid I answer your query?

"Hello,I recently replaced a failing RAID 5 HDD(HGST) in a server from a supplier who gave me a Seagate ST10000NM018B HDD which is equivalent in specifications. The drive came online and the RAID rebuilt without a problem, but in the OSMA software it shows a warning because some of the information is missing(see attached pic) and the logs said something to the effect of ""HDD detected from unsupported vendor"". The drive status shows it being online, and these servers are close to end of life anyway and will be changed soon, is this something that I could safety overlook for now?.","Hi @Harry44, If the drive is not a Dell certified drive, you may encounter such incident. This is because Lifecycle Controller/iDRAC is trying to communicate with the drive, but unable to retrieve Dell firmware data, the information displayed will be unknown/not available. The drive works, only informational data from the drive is not displayed. Since you mentioned that the servers are going to be replaced, I would say you can safely overlook for now.DELL-Joey CSocial Media and Communities ProfessionalDell Technologies | Enterprise Support ServicesDid I answer your query?

I have a LSI raid card in the rear of my R610 and the card runs a bit warm during backups.   Like 85-87c.   Normally its around 72c.    It has a heatsink on it but no fan.  Was wondering if anyone has tried a PCI SLot fan to cool the back of the case a little more.Thanks!  .,Just a follow up for any one using a LSI card in the R610.  Yes they can run hot but they are also quite old.   I decided to take its heat sink off and found the paste was dried up. I put some artic silver 5 on it and it dropped the temps down to 59c idle 64c load and that is with me putting the R610 fans lower (there is a way to trick it to run fans as if there was not extra card in rear slot).  Good enough no issues. Before idle 72c load 87c With high case fans (loud)After 59c idle 63c load (Lower r610 fans)It was even cooler with the R610 fans (3c) louder but not enough to make me stick with it.Here is how to trick the fansREM The below command from dos prompt will reset the idrac 6 and the fans often will come back up slower than on intial boot up = less noise! from 7200rpm on 1/2 the fans to 4800 and 3720 rpm.

I am going to remove the mid plane on my R730XD as I don't need the drive bays and switch back to the base configuration/standard heatsinks in hopes of dropping CPU temps to make the fan noise more reasonable.My question is that there appears to be an option for some beefier 165w rated heatsinks (PN: XCYJ9 and NGC09) do these fit under the stock air shroud ( PN: Y43D5) or do I need to get a different shroud?.,the black plastic air shroud fits over the bigger L shaped heat sinks.The 4x 3.5 drive midplane does not fit over the bigger heat sinks.The bigger heatsink is part number Dell YY2R8 They can be found on ebay for like $10I run dual 150W E5-2696v4 cpus on my R730xd with those heatsinks no problemYou can also just manually control the fan speed with ipmi commandsHere is a walkthrough ,

Is it possible to do so ? If yes, can you indicates me which IPMI command I should use please ?I've searched for a Dell PowerEdge IPMI documentation but I didn't find anything, does it exist ?

"Hi,We upgraded memory to our PowerEdge R730 ,  ESXi 6.0.0 production server.Before upgrade it has 16 x 8GB of RAM, DDR-4, single Rank, RDIMM modules, installed in A1 to A8 and B1 to B8 sockets.We added 8 x 16GB RAM , DDR-4, single Rank, RDIMM modules, and installed in A9 to A12 and B9 to B12 sockets.We have the following warning during boot and recorded in Lifecycle log for every memory slot which is populated with new 16GB modules (A9-A12 and B9-B2) : ""UEFI0104 The DIMM module on memory slot (A9-12 or B9-12) is populated out of order in the DIM channel.""After the boot , Server itself and ESXi server correctly recognize total amount of memory and there are no other warnings or errors.We asume that this warning is because as per documentation memory modules with larger capacity should be installed in first slots (in our case 16 GB modules should be installed in A1-A4 and B1 to B4)and then memory modules with lower capacity should be installed (in our case in A5-A12 and B5 to B12).My question is, is it safe to leave the memory as it is, since it is a production server and we don't want to shut it down again, and there are no problems in last 24h since the upgrade was done? Can this warning be ignored in this case? Thank you, Kind regards,Jancic  .","Hello Jancic, I would recommend at your soonest maintenance window to change the memory population to follow the rules to match what you post:16 GB modules should be installed in A1-A4 and B1 to B48 GB modules should be installed in A5-A12 and B5 to B12 NOTE: Memory configurations that fail to observe these guidelines can prevent your system from booting, hanging during memory configuration, or operating with reduced memory.Dell -Charles RSocial Media and Communities ProfessionalDell Technologies | Enterprise Support ServicesDid I answer your query?

"Hi Everyone,We have a M1000e chassis with 2 Brocade M6505 FC IOMs (B1/B2) and 9 working blades (M620/M630). The Brocades have 12 port licenses from which 1 is available. Brocades have DPOD mode enabled.The switchshow command shows active ports as 'N16 Online FC F-Port <HBA WWPN>' and the unused but licensed port 'In_Sync FC Disabled (Persistent)'.When we insert a new M630 blade with a dual port FC Qlogic QME2662 mezzanine HBA in slot B (fabric B), status of port 11 does not change and there is no connection indication on the Brocade, and the blade iDRAC shows the port 'down' and 'No Link'.  Note that the M630 has already OS installed (XenServer).We issue the ""portcfgpersistentenable 11"" command but we get: ""Port 11: portcfgpersistentenable failed. Configuration operation is not supported on internal (server blade) port.""The same blade was inserted to a slot of another already working blade and the switch detected it normally, showing the WWPN and the port going 'online' both on Brocade and in iDRAC. That eliminates any blade misconfiguration possibility. In this port portcfgpersistentdisable and portcfgpersistentenable commands are working normally. Note that when this slot is empty it shows as 'No_SigDet' and not as 'Disabled (Persistent)'.We included port 11 in the zoning configuration (forcibly aliasing the blade's WWPN) but no change in port status. Are we missing something here? Does anyone have an idea on how to proceed?.","Thank you Charles for your reply! Yes, we had already tried the other working blade in this slot and didn't work, so we were sure that this was a Brocade and not a blade issue. Also our Brocades are not configured in Access Gateway mode but in Native mode.After all basic and advanced troubleshooting has been done on the Brocades we decided to do a rolling restart on the 2 FC switches. After the reboot the first Brocade immediately detected the new M630 on (licensed) port 11 as 'N16 Online FC F-Port <HBA WWPN>'. The second Brocade did not immediately detect the blade but after a 'portcfgpersistentenable 11', which now worked without error, it detected the new blade too!The rolling reboot did not affect the production traffic at all, as the system (XenServer) had multipath enabled with active-active configuration.So, case is closed.",

"Hi All,I have searched high and low for a reference to this interesting situation to no avail.  I have a EMC T440 that originally came with  a single Xeon Silver 4110 CPU.  I have since added a second processor - primarily to gain access to the single PCIe x16 slot tied to CPU2.  The processor is functioning just as expected and has even passed every stress-test I have thrown at it.While investigating an issue where installation of a GPU in that aforementioned x16 slot is triggering the chassis fan to ramp up to high-speed unnecessarily, I ventured into iDRAC (I don't really use it that much otherwise).  It is here where the second CPU is detailed (Cores, L1/L2/L3 cache, etc), but indicated to be ""Absent"" - while CPU1 shows ""Presence Detected"".Normally, I would just dismiss this since the CPU is functioning as it should where it matters.  But since I am unable to adjust the thermal profile for that slot with the GPU in it, I am starting to wonder if iDRAC's incorrect marking of the presence of the CPU is also leading to issues with the PCIe slot linked to it - and subsequently leading to the issues with setting LFM with the GPU present.  It should be noted, the GPU, a not-officially-supported BUT Dell-branded Radeon is also not detected in iDRAC either.  Since the lone PCIe x16 slot is linked to CPU2, I am starting to think these issues may be related.CPU2 shows ""Absent""BUT, it details the specs of an ""Absent"" CPU.  But CPU2 is certainly here - 2 x 16 Threads (8 Physical Cores) = 32.So, any ideas on why iDRAC does't think CPU2 is socketed (but can detail its specs)?  Is there some contact on the socket perhaps that triggers iDRAC's detection of the CPU's presence?  I DID have to slightly modify the heatsink module bracket to get the CPU to socket properly.  And while the CPU if functioning properly, is there some contact switch down there that this modification is failing to trigger perhaps?.","I've ran into this before on similar systems.

Generally when replacing PowerEdge servers I can reuse the previous generation's sliding rails. However these R340s are giving me problems as they don't appear to be compatible to anything. I found the DellEMC Enterprise Systems Rail Sizing and Rack Compatibility Matrix which tells me that A12 rails are compatible.So we bought the A12 rails but they have the same problem as the previous rails I was using for the R320s. The new R340s have their first mount point set back from the front. So when I place the server in the rails they end up sticking out of the front of the server cabinet. What rails are compatible with PowerEdge R340 servers? Thank you..,Just went back to the server room and tried again and I realise now the rails are spring loaded and you need to push them back until the server clips into the rack.So mystery solved.,

"Hi,we have an old R720 server that came with a PERC H310 Mini Mono controller.Since that stock controller has no cache memory, we would like to replace with with a newer PERC.Looking around the forum I have found old threads that indicate the H710p Mini Mono as a compatible replacement.However, I can only find used/refurbished units from third-party sellers, within a very large range of prices, and that leaves me quite unsure about what to do.I wonder: is there an even newer PERC that is compatible with our server?

"Hello Everyone ,i am new to this forum and hope someone can help mewe have a list of servers in our environment and was wondering if there is a way to have a command line utility or a script that i can use to set the Asset tag on all the servers.we are talking about a long list so if there any way to automate this via a script and pending a reboot would be appreciated  .","Yeah, don't listen to these other guys. They clearly aren't reading or understanding your question. Since you want to script it, you'll want to use racadm. The command is going to look like this:racadm>>get BIOS.MiscSettingsracadm get BIOS.MiscSettings[Key=BIOS.Setup.1-1#MiscSettings]AssetTag=ErrPrompt=DisabledForceInt10=DisabledNumLock=Onracadm>>set BIOS.MiscSettings.AssetTag 12345racadm set BIOS.MiscSettings.AssetTag 12345[Key=BIOS.Setup.1-1#MiscSettings]RAC1017: Successfully modified the object value and the change is in       pending state.       To apply modified value, create a configuration job and reboot       the system. To create the commit and reboot jobs, use ""jobqueue""       command. For more information about the ""jobqueue"" command, see RACADM       help.After that, you'll want to create a job like this:racadm jobqueue create BIOS.Setup.1-1 -r noneAnd then reboot the machine since most BIOS changes require a reboot. Not sure if this one does or not. You should test this first, of course.racadm serveraction powercycle How you wrap your script will be up to your scripting skills, preferred language, or environment. I use python with pexpect to simulate an interactive session. I use a lot of regex and catch expected output from racadm. Beware that output may vary from generation to generation (e.g. iDRAC8 and iDRAC9 have different output strings).",

I have a Dell R320 that has been running well for about 2 years. All of a sudden I find that the screen was frozen and that the mouse and keyboard do not function. After rebooting the hardware it told me that there were no disks installed. I reconfigured the machine and it sees the disk as it did before. Now it gets to the point of initializing but freezes there . If it had not froze the next step would have been collecting the life cycle data. Therefore my question is if there is any software I can run to find out what has gone wrong? I did test the disk in question in another R320 I have and it boots normally. Any suggestions or questions are welcome..,I had already removed the disk but had not tried to start it without one. As per your suggestion I have now done that. It took about 2 mins longer then it used to but it did get me to the no boot device message. As I had already tested the disk and it appears good I put it back in and started the machine. It completed the hardware start up in the usual time and booted the OS I have on that disk. As a final test upgraded the OS on that disk and it is 100 percent good now.,

This causes, as far as I know, a loss of service for the traffic going through those interfaces (switch sees the flap, and so does DMESG). [ 9681.468245] bnxt_en 0000:19:00.1 eno8403np1: NIC Link is Up, 10000 Mbps full duplex, Flow control: none[ 9681.468249] bnxt_en 0000:19:00.1 eno8403np1: FEC autoneg off encodings: None[ 9681.468289] bnxt_en 0000:19:00.2 eno8503np2: NIC Link is Up, 10000 Mbps full duplex, Flow control: ON - receive & transmit[ 9681.468291] bnxt_en 0000:19:00.2 eno8503np2: FEC autoneg off encodings: None[ 9684.796878] bnxt_en 0000:19:00.3 eno8603np3: NIC Link is Up, 10000 Mbps full duplex, Flow control: ON - receive & transmit[ 9684.796882] bnxt_en 0000:19:00.3 eno8603np3: FEC autoneg off encodings: None[ 9686.076420] bnxt_en 0000:19:00.1 eno8403np1: NIC Link is Down[ 9686.327785] bnxt_en 0000:19:00.2 eno8503np2: NIC Link is Down[ 9686.328264] bnxt_en 0000:19:00.3 eno8603np3: NIC Link is Down[ 9687.848387] bnxt_en 0000:19:00.3 eno8603np3: NIC Link is Up, 10000 Mbps full duplex, Flow control: ON - receive & transmit[ 9687.848391] bnxt_en 0000:19:00.3 eno8603np3: FEC autoneg off encodings: None[ 9688.113243] bnxt_en 0000:19:00.2 eno8503np2: NIC Link is Up, 10000 Mbps full duplex, Flow control: ON - receive & transmit[ 9688.113247] bnxt_en 0000:19:00.2 eno8503np2: FEC autoneg off encodings: None[ 9690.414869] bnxt_en 0000:19:00.1 eno8403np1: NIC Link is Up, 10000 Mbps full duplex, Flow control: none[ 9690.414873] bnxt_en 0000:19:00.1 eno8403np1: FEC autoneg off encodings: None[ 9693.494675] bnxt_en 0000:19:00.1 eno8403np1: NIC Link is Down[ 9693.749108] bnxt_en 0000:19:00.3 eno8603np3: NIC Link is Down[ 9694.000669] bnxt_en 0000:19:00.2 eno8503np2: NIC Link is Down[ 9695.534315] bnxt_en 0000:19:00.2 eno8503np2: NIC Link is Up, 10000 Mbps full duplex, Flow control: ON - receive & transmit[ 9695.534319] bnxt_en 0000:19:00.2 eno8503np2: FEC autoneg off encodings: None[ 9695.534438] bnxt_en 0000:19:00.3 eno8603np3: NIC Link is Up, 10000 Mbps full duplex, Flow control: ON - receive & transmit[ 9695.534442] bnxt_en 0000:19:00.3 eno8603np3: FEC autoneg off encodings: None[ 9696.558854] bnxt_en 0000:19:00.1 eno8403np1: NIC Link is Up, 10000 Mbps full duplex, Flow control: none[ 9696.558858] bnxt_en 0000:19:00.1 eno8403np1: FEC autoneg off encodings: None(Weirdly, the eno8303np0 doesn't flap now, but it did earlier, the only difference I can see is that this interface has a static IP, while the others are used for L2 traffic and bridged to virtual interfaces). The servers are running Ubuntu Server 20.04.5 and one of them has the latest 22.31.13.70 firmware provided by Dell installed, while the other has a slightly lower version.

"Question: Is there any additional or other way to restore or set the branding to show a Model of R640?Background: I have a Dell R640 that came to me with ""Dell IDPA"" branding. When I looked up the Service Tag, the system *did not* show as an OEM/OEMR/OEM-R. Since it had to be an OEM for Dell DP4400's(the IDPA server hardware), I tried to ""fix"" branding based on information like:https://www.dell.com/community/PowerEdge-Hardware-General/Missing-Model-Name-and-Manufacturer-in-iDR...https://www.dell.com/community/PowerEdge-Hardware-General/Missing-Model-Name-and-Manufacturer-in-iDR...That information lead me the ""Dell PowerEdge OEMR 14G ID Module"" from https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-us/drivers/driversdetails?driverId=9GFXR via the EOM page of https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-us/product-support/product/oth-r640/drivers. Following the directions *removed* the the ""R640 IDPA"" ""Model"" from iDRAC and BIOS and has left it blank. This is actually a little worse that having the IDPA left behind!My preference would be to restore, but I'm open to direction on how to *set* that information (which I can't seem to find much information on how).Additionally, the directions from the ""Dell PowerEdge OEMR 14G ID Module"" have a very confusing direction of,""16. Custom Branding is now complete. You may now validate all of the custom branding options you have selected including Logos, BIOS Settings, iDRAC Settings, and Lifecycle Controller settings.""This leads me to believe that the ""Dell PowerEdge OEMR 14G ID Module"" is actually trying to *set* OEM pieces and not restore. Is there an easy way to set the information? Also, what is the purpose of the ""9GFXR_Cust_5_00.pm"" versus the ""9GFXR_CustBSU_5_00.pm""? I can't figure that information out at this time..","I'm not sure if I did not properly follow the instructions or what, but using the Identity Module from the ""4XHVW_14G_DBE_CustBSU_3_00.exe"" (https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-vc/drivers/driversdetails?driverid=4xhvw) worked this most recent time.Since I run Linux servers, the only note I have is that the you do not need a windows system to extract the *.exe file. Just use 7z instead:(to list the contents)7z l 4XHVW_14G_DBE_CustBSU_3_00.exe (to extract the contents)7z x 4XHVW_14G_DBE_CustBSU_3_00.exe Then upload to the iDRAC as the instructions from the page above states.So, I must have done something wrong the first couple of times.Thanks for looking.",https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-vc/drivers/driversdetails?driverid=4xhvw)

"Hey,After restarting the server following some changes in the system (on other servers).I restarted the server and encountered several errors:All the disks started flashing amber (13 disks) after a few minutes some became solid green, and all the rest appear as failed state. (Before the restart there was no disk failure)No hardware changes were made to the server.There are 11 disks in RAID 6 (include hotspare)and 2 disks in RAID 1on which the operating system sits.In iDrac I received a message of - RAID 6 Degraded and RAID 1 disappeared.I wish you could help me or at least direct me, I don't have much experience with hardware problems of this magnitudeDetails of the server :PowerEdge R720xdBIOS Version 2.2.2Firmware version 1.57.57 (Build 04)Lifecycle controller firmware 2.21.21.21I would appreciate any help, advice or guidance on how to proceed from here.Regards,Osher..","Hello sci-hpc, I'm sorry to see the failed drives. I would recommend to consider if you have a backup and  if you need this data but do not have a valid backup that you should contact a Data Recovery company. Along with what Shine mentioned; the other very concerning thing I see is all the drives report 0GB in size (capacity).Do the drives spin up? Are there any lights lit on the drives? I can't imagine this happen with just a restart unless some previous issues have been occurring or you have experienced an issue that regular firmware updates could have mitigated. The system is very far behind in firmware and it could be some issue happened that may have been resolved with regular updates. I can't say for sure I'm just trying to give possibilities. Have you reviewed the iDRAC System Event Log for any issues before this happened? So after you consider the status of your backup you can try these steps below. I say to consider if you need data recovery as any troubleshooting could make it harder for data recovery if it is possible at all.  The array configuration is stored in two places; the drives and the controller.You may try shut down, unseat all drives, boot to the controller and  clear the configuration and shut down.Then seat all the drives and boot into the Controller BIOS to see if it imported the arrays or has a foreign configuration that you can import. Next steps you can update the system firmware and retry to import:You will need to step up the BIOS and iDRAC together iDRAC is thirteen revisions behind2.63.60.62, A0027 May 2019Do 7th2.61.60.60, A0005 Dec 2018 2.60.60.60, A0025 Jun 2018Do 6th2.52.52.52, A0006 Mar 2018 2.50.50.50, A0026 Sep 2017Do 5th2.41.40.40, A0014 Nov 2016 2.40.40.40, A0012 Oct 2016 2.30.30.30, A0030 Mar 2016Do 4th2.21.21.21, A0009 Nov 2015 2.20.20.20, A0010 Sep 2015Do 3rd2.15.10.10, A0025 Jun 2015 2.10.10.10, A0005 Apr 2015Do 2nd1.66.65, A0001 Dec 2014Do 1st1.57.57, A0006 May 2014 You are here   BIOS is seven revisions behind2.8.001 Oct 2019Do 7th2.7.027 Jun 2018Do 6th2.6.107 Mar 2018Do 5th2.5.417 Feb 2016Do 4th2.5.201 Apr 2015Do 3rd2.4.309 Oct 2014Do 2nd2.2.330 May 2014Do 1st2.2.206 Mar 2014You are here I can't tell about the PERC controller or the hard drive firmware.You can find the firmware here : https://dell.to/3jIShZB Dell -Charles RSocial Media and Communities ProfessionalDell Technologies | Enterprise Support ServicesDid I answer your query?

OMSA seems to be reporting the memory are having no issue. To delete the logs, you can access to iDRAC via Ctrl-E: https://dell.to/3iFbxTZ Try clearing the logs, it may help to clear the error. Since the system is able to detect all of the memory and if the error still pop ups, you can ignore the error message, as it might be a system bug issue.

"I have a T410 with I bought with a single E5504 processor and 2x2GB RAM.I would like to run it with 64GB so I bought four 16GB memory modules: Micron 16GB 2RX4 PC3L-12800R.According to the following document this should be supported, if configured for Optimizer mode in the BIOS.https://dl.dell.com/manuals/all-products/esuprt_ser_stor_net/esuprt_poweredge/poweredge-t410_user's%...I have changed the BIOS setting (after I remembered it the first time booting failed with four modules) and I can boot the server with two of these installed (in A1 and A2) - the BIOS says that the RAM is running at 800MHz and I understand that to be a limitation of the CPU. But if I install all four modules, or even just three (in A1, A2, A3) the server appears not to boot - it sits at ""Configuring memory, please wait."" I haven't left it for hours to get past that, could it be that that's what I need to do?I'm wondering if this might also be a limitation of the processor. But the processor spec page seems to indicate that it supports three memory channels and much more than the 64GB I have.Some clarifications:I took out the modules which were in A1 and A2 and put in there the ones which were in A3 and A4. The machine still boots. So it does not seem that the issue is a faulty module.All firmware is at the latest version, to the best of my knowledge - with the exception of the BMC (BIOS is at 1.14).Does anyone have an idea what the issue might be?Thanks.","It turns out that my previous messages were on the right track. There was damage to the CPU socket, fortunately not of the replace-the-motherboard variety.I ordered a pair of CPUs (as I thought I could at least use all four DIMMs by putting two on each CPU). When I installed the first CPU I noticed something not quite right in the socket but ignored it at that point. Here's what I saw (I have circled the problem): But with the second CPU installed I was getting E1410 errors and the machine wouldn't boot so I had to take everything apart again and investigate. When I looked more closely I realised that this pin was out of place (I'm not sure if it was bent or just caught on the neighbouring pin) but I managed to get it back from the red position to the green position.That didn't solve my dual-CPU issue but I found that with one CPU, it would now see all 64GB, which it had not done before. So the original memory issue was apparently due to that pin above.Ultimately (for anyone who is interested) I did resolve the E1410 error - I think what did it was cleaning the second CPU socket by dabbing with a tissue moistened with isopropyl alcohol as Intel or Dell documentation mentions somewhere. As of now the machine boots with two L5640s and 64GB RAM (16GB in each of A1, A2, B1, B2), and I hope it will remain stable.",

"Hello,I've reached the end of my rope trying to figure this out since I'm pretty new to what I'm dealing with. I've been after this for several days and I have no idea how to accomplish this.I'm used to the old school way of having to create DOS boot disks and whatnot to update firmware, but I haven't done any for years. I came into some ""luck"" and got a big case of white box Intel branded X710 quad port adapters. What I need is to update the firmware as they are quite old. I have the Intel firmware downloaded and it apparently runs from what is called an ""EFI Shell"".I do not have an EFI boot manager in any of my menus (not that I can find anyway) in order to use this utility. Iv'e tried using the utilities where you browse for a file on USB, but it doesn't like this file (nvmupdate64e.efi) for whatever reason and it just kicks me back out every time I select it. It appears that the functions I am trying to use is only for Dell BIOS updates, I'm just not sure.Can anyone help me with this? I need an explanation of how this works and how to achieve this. Of all the google hits, they all revolve around BIOS updates. I'm really hoping there is a way to do this, I just can't figure it out..","Your post gave me just enough information to finally figure this out, so thank you.I was misunderstanding how EFI boot works in general (I'm a little bit TOO old school sometimes), and this got me over the final hump. The link was very helpful. I'm just so used to using the easy-button in the lifecycle controller, the non-standard approach was throwing me off.For anyone else reading, if you are trying to do non-Dell device firmware updates such as Intel NIC's in efi file format, go to the link above and get the ""shell.efi"" file, and put in in a directory on your fat32 formatted USB stick like this: /efi/boot/Shell.efi, then rename the file to Boot64.efi. When done, you should have  /efi/boot/Boot64.efi.  In addition, copy any firmware files or programs you may need into a separate directory on the same usb stick for use after you get the shell running.Plugin your USB stick to the machine you are working with and set your BIOS to boot UEFI mode, then on post, press F11 to enter the one shot UEFI boot manager. Once there, select your USB stick from the list, and the machine should boot into the EFI shell from the USB stick. After that, just google for the commands that the EFI shell will accept.Those were my steps used on R730, R730XD,, and R620 equipment. Also to note, I tried using the remote mapping of the USB stick using the iDRAC virtual media and updated 2 units remotely and it works fine. Just keep in mind that in the F11 boot menu, the ""virtual floppy"" will be the device you select as there will be no remote USB in the list. I would also not try to update firmware remotely unless you have a rock-solid and reliable network connection... any interruption in the flashing process can and probably will render the device dead.Thanks again Martin!",

"Hello,I've previously purchased a PowerEdge T550, but opted to leave off the BOSS-S2 module at build time. Now that I've been running the system for a few months, I am working on reconfiguring how some of my drives are arranged - and plan to pass through the RAID controller and an HBA to a storage-focused VM. It seems the cleanest way to move the hypervisor out into its own separate controller (to avoid passthrough to the VM) would be to add the BOSS-S2 module. Looking at the parts available from the support page, I found the following: Dell BOSS-S2 Controller Card without Cable Dell 480GB SSD M2 SATA 6GB/s 512e Hard Drive - Single Stick I wanted to confirm a few things here before I put in the order:Is this BOSS-S2 card the same that would have come with the T550 originally? Looking at the manual, I see it slots in to a bay on the front. As there's no picture, it's hard to tell if it is the same one.The BOSS-S2 listing mentions ""without cable"". Is there a separate cable item I need to purchase? Is the cabling already present in the T550? I don't see a listing for ""BOSS-S2 Controller Card with Cable"".  Is the M.2 SSD I listed compatible with the BOSS-S2?I am working on the assumption that the BOSS-S2 will show up as a separate disk controller. Is that accurate? Thanks a lot in advance for any help. - Clay.","I believe it will come with all required parts other than cable and M.2 drives. I am not sure on M.2 Blank also.

"Hi there,Trying to figure out my power consumption of servers with respect of installing a new AC unit and potentially adding a battery pack on UPS.

Your thoughts?Granted I am not including the room size etc. but I just wanted to make sure that I am calculating the consumption of servers correctly. I have also read that these are just starting numbers and that number of disks in raid and memory sticks in server will draw more power...something as adding 10W per per disk/memory stick...is this true??Thanks for your time!.","No , you need to use the clamp over individual wires, not over a 3 or 4 wire bundle in a cord. Best to find the circuit at the breaker box, remove cover, and clamp on one of the circuit legs off the breaker. I would leave it connect for a day , monitor it for peak power consumption. You will need to get lighting power consumption figured into the total, and heat gain through wall/floor/ceiling/door.",

On the R720 the easiest way to do this is to hold down the i button on the front of the server for more than 15 seconds, this will do a soft reboot of the iDRAC. If the iDRAC is still not responsive after you do this please power off the server and unplug it for about a minute, while it is unplugged hold the power button in for 10 seconds, this will drain any power from the system so that the iDRAC powers off fully.

"First-time poster here, after exhausting all my googling abilities I am stuck. I have an R820 that I received second hand and it appears that the backplane was never used by its first owner, as none of the power/signal/SAS cables were connected, and the bays were all filled with blanks. The server would boot and run fine off a USB flash drive, but when attempting to connect a RAID card and make use of the backplane I continuously get stuck on the Initializing Firmware Interfaces screen.  Looking in the idrac logs the following exception occurs around the time in which the server appears to hang. In an attempt to remedy the issue I tried first removing the raid card, which allowed the system to boot normally. Replacing the generic raid card with an H200A yielded the same results as the other card, and the H200A was pulled from a working system moments before in an attempt to isolate the issue.  Furthermore, this only happens when the raid card is connected and a logical disk is configured. Destroying the array and attempting to boot allows the system to post and boot fine. I'm at my wits end on this one, as I can't figure out why a healthy raid array would cause a system hangup like this. All firmware is current to my knowledge, the lifecycle controller does not report any updates available. I unfortunately don't have any extra hardware to test with beyond what I have already done.  I have tried fully resetting the system to factory defaults using the built-in method on the lifecycle controller, as well as continuously trying to change settings and power cycling the system to see if I could find any conflicts within the BIOS. Another weird artifact I found during the process was that when trying to boot in UEFI mode, the raid configuration utility will never be loaded. Upon requesting the array config utility during startup, I get a message stating that the utility will load after firmware initialization is complete, but after initializing I get dumped straight into the boot sequence.  Happy to post any further explanations/logs/photos upon request. Any help is greatly appreciated! .","Hi @CanadianBacon, I assume H200A is a PERC card that was tried to isolate the issue, the PE R820 is compatible with Series 8 Family PERC Controllers, whereas the H200A falls under the 6 & 7 series PERC controllers. Please try the installation procedure using one of the following RAID controllers H310, H710, H710P, and H810.DELL-Dheeraj KSocial Media and Communities ProfessionalDell Technologies | Enterprise Support ServicesDid I answer your query?

I ask as OEMRs are purchased on a reduced cost on the OEM purchase program. Also you can't take an OEMR system back to Dell branded, so if it was intended to be an OEMR type it won't have the things you are looking at.So, if it was ordered incorrectly, or you received the wrong system type, you should work with your account team to get it RMA'd, as support won't have the same ability. Let me know if this helps.  DELL-Chris HSocial Media and Communities ProfessionalDell Technologies | Enterprise Support ServicesDid I answer your query?

Many thanks.   .","Aw5585, The reason you're seeing the training error is that while the R730xd supports the Quadro K1200, the R730 doesn't.The R730 does look to support the Quadro P5000 (p/n# 00MKC) and M5000 (p/n# Y1P3V) models though. Let me know if this helps.DELL-Chris HSocial Media and Communities ProfessionalDell Technologies | Enterprise Support ServicesDid I answer your query?

"We have a Dell PowerEdge FC630 server that is not wanting to cooperate. It houses a VMWare ESXi Host. Last week, the host migrated all of the VMs to other Hosts, and was inaccessible within VSphere. We rebooted the blade in hope that would correct the issue. The issue we are now facing is that during the boot process, the server is asking for a password. After much reading and researching, I think this to be a setup password of some kind. Unfortunately, this server was configured well before my time and I apparently do not have this password. I've tried many, many different ones I thought it could be to no avail. Default passwords included (calvin). Here is the screenshot of where the iDrac Virtual Console is asking for the password:I have read in the manual that a password can be removed by moving the jumper on the system board from pins 1 and 2 to 2 and 3, although I am unsure if this will reset that password in the screenshot. I tried this, but after putting the sled back in the chassis and booting it, the server never fully booted back up. I waited probably 10-15 minutes for the power button to stop flashing green before powering it off, moving the jumper back to the original pins, and booting it. The server did power back on and I was able to get to the iDrac again, but it still prompting for this password.We are working on gaining support for the server blade, but until then, I figured I would see if anyone had more information that could be useful to this issue.Last resort would be to reset the blade and reinstall the VMWare Host, but we are really trying to keep from having to do that.Thanks in advance if anyone has any ideas or recommendations!.","The PWRD_EN jumper will clear the password which you shown in the screenshot. After installing the jumper to 2-3 are you able to see the system booting. We need to wait till complete POST after installing jumper.
