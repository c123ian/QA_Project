"Hi,I haven't used my PowerEdge T620 in a year or so. When I just turned it ON, it says:Configuring Memory....and that's it. Nothing happens. It has been doing this for 30 minutes now. I remember having done something like this over a year ago and it did the same thing. I believe I waited for hours and then turned it off. Anyhow, does anyone know what the problem could be? I have 64GB installed and maybe I can take out some memory sticks and see what happens. If that is a good idea, I would need to know in which slots I then have to plug in the memory. The manual is a bit funkt when wanting to use 32GB with 8GB sticks... Thanks.

You can make drain power at first as a few steps you can try.
Drain server flea power and check for any error messages during POST
1) Remove any external peripherals from the server
2) Turn system off and remove input power from the server
3) Hold down power button for 10 seconds with power unplugged and then wait for one minute
4) Re-apply input power and turn system on.

"Hi
I'm not sure what they are called but my PE2950 is missing the side 'mushrooms' for rack mounting. These are the parts that fit onto the threaded studs in the side of the chassis (3 each side) that then drop into the sliding rails. The bits circled in red:

Is it possible to buy these from Dell? I've not managed to find anything so far.
Thanks,

Simon

"Hi All !
Does anyone know of a Cuda PCIe 3.0 video card that will work in PowerEdge T330 and T430 server? 
Especially GeForce GTX 1080 Ti. I need it only for GPU coprocessor purposes.
Thanks for any suggestions.
Vlad.



					
						
					
					.","Hello.
The T330 server does not support GPU cards. GeForce GTX 1080 Ti has not been tested and certified to function on the T430 server. It may(not) work. Below are details of GPU cards that have been tested on T430 server.


However, for any of these cards to operate correctly, you will need: 

Redundant PSU configuration (PIB)
One 1100 W power supply
GPU power cable (DPN#: DRXPD)

Thank you.

"Hi, I think the BIOS settings will default after a CMOS battery replacement. But please, can someone confirm this?I have PowerEdge R430.Also, is any way to backup BIOS settings over iDRAC 8?TY TY TY.



					
						
					
					.","Hello Alexander,
 
You are correct. If the battery is out for any length of time the BIOS would revert to defaults.
 
If you have the iDRAC Enterprise license you can Back up the server profile
https://dell.to/3WOQlhW
 
Backup server profile
Use this licensed feature to perform the following and store the backup image files in a vFlash SD card:
*Back up the following:
*Hardware and firmware inventory such as BIOS, NDCs, Lifecycle Controller supported add-in NIC cards, and Storage Controllers (RAID level, virtual disk, and controller attributes)
*System information
*Lifecycle Controller firmware images, data and configuration, and iDRAC firmware and configuration
*Optionally, secure the backup image file with a passphrase.
 
I think the BIOS in the firmware inventory is just the firmware version. I don't see a way to back up the individual BIOS settings.
You may go through the BIOS and note down any specific settings or take pictures of the BIOS pages with the custom settings you have.

"Hi,Since nothing is working on my T620 and its completely dead, I thought about checking if maybe the Front Panel is broken, and reseating the cables might do something. However, I cannot get the Panel out? I watched a video on how to do it, which is just loosening one screw, but that did not work for me. How do I get the dang thing out???Second question: If indeed my Motherboard is broken, wouldn't there still be power on the front panel? I mean, isn't that what the Panel is for, to tell you if and what is not working properly?Anything helps.Thanks.

It could be a couple things, such as that your configuration may require removing the cooling fan assembly. You can find the details on page 114 here.

That would not be a supported configuration since the other dimms are larger. As seen on page 81 here, the larger dimms must be populated first.You can also find the other memory population guidelines there as well.

"I've just updated the iDRAC in a PowerEdge R340 from 5.10.10.00 to the newly released 6.00.00.00All appears to be working ok, apart from the fans are now running at ~11,000 rpm rather than the ~3,800 rpm they were on the previous version.I've tried rolling back to the older version and the fans went back to normal.Upgrade again to v6 and they're screaming again.Anybody else seeing the same behaviour?Cheers,Rob

"I have a PowerEdge c6100 arriving soon.   It is a bottom end model with the Xeon 5520 processors. For the majority of what this server will be used for, that is more than enough. But for one blade the application in it will vastly benefit from a higher frequency rather than multi-cores. Doing a quick check I found that the 5520 is a socket 1366.  But when I check spec sheets for the server it mentions only the 5500 and 5600 series processors.  A little more digging shows that those 2 series were just factory options.   To my question: Is this server ~ONLY~ compatible with the 55/56 series processors or is it compatible with anything that fits the socket so to say?  Before I spend another grand on 2 CPUs with 3.4 Ghz I would like to know if they would work!

~Thanks ahead of time, Tony



					
						
					
					.","Thanks for your question. It looks like the fastest option available is the X5672, a 3.2ghz option.  Further research shows the board will accept up to 95w processors only.  The 3.4ghz option you are referring to is a 139w CPU.

"Hi there,I've got a PowerEdge R320, great deal, £70 for an E5-2450, 48gb ram, dedicated enterprise iDRAC, both 350w PSU's and 3TB HDDs with a raid controller. However, I'm having lots of trouble when I'm running into updating the iDRAC firmware. I'm a bit of a neat freak so I'd really love everything to be as up-to-date as possible and I've gone through countless steps trying to fix this. Right now, It's on version 2.21.21. I haven't had any trouble updating the BIOS firmware but I have now rolled it back to its original 2.4.2 from having updated it to 2.9.0 . I have installed Windows Server 2012 R2 on it to try and get it to install from there but still no hope. I don't actually get that much of an error message when i do it, but its usually RED004. I've had a couple times where I've tried and the website comes up with iDRAC 8 instead of  iDRAC7. I have also tried hard resetting it with the command:racadm racreset hard -f Although this works to get iDRAC back into it's regular state after the firmware update going weird, trying again just gives similar errors and I have tried updating via the web page. This has been trying to upgrade to 2.30.30 and 2.65.65 I believe. Any help is much appreciated!



					
						
					
					.","Hi Joey,Today is the day it happened!I successfully updated the iDRAC firmware to 2.65.65.65 from 2.21.21.21.Firstly, I'd like to say thank you for your help in troubleshooting the situation and sticking with me throughout this nightmare.After having tried every method under the sun, iDRAC would still not update. Luckily, I found a great guy on YouTube (shoutout to him) going over his steps to fix a bricked iDRAC. Luckily, in my situation my iDRAC wasn't necessarily 'bricked'; iDRAC had no problem working even after the hundred failed firmware update attempts that I had tried. Although my situation wasn't exactly like his, the methods used to try and treat a bricked iDRAC managed to treat mine as well.So these are the steps I took to fix this problem (For an R320 or similar) Just to be said, I am not a qualified electrician. These are purely the steps I took to overcome this problem:You will need:USB UART device, one capable of 3.3v. (Cheap from Amazon)Soldering ironSD Card in the FAT format loaded with the firmware.d7 file in the root folder.iDRAC Enterprise cardSpare PC or Laptop with PuTTY installed.Make sure you export your iDRAC license. This can be done by the web GUI. If necessary also export you iDRAC settings as this will completely wipe all iDRAC configuration.On the motherboard there will be a BMC_UART port right next to the rear I/O of the MB. The connection pinout is: R320 (or similar) BMC_UARTFunctionPin 1 (Square Pad)Vdd (3.3v)Pin 2TxPin 3RxPin 4GNDSolder 4 jumper wires onto the board and connect them to the USB UART dongle as followed. Make sure the server is off!Connect to the serial port in PuTTY with your COM interface (if you're unsure what interface to use, check device manager) with a baudrate of 115200 using TELNET. Now you can boot the server. If those steps were successful, you should now see the uboot process of the server. If it has booted successfully, you should be greeted with a linux shell but in this situation we wont be needing that. Although it's a good idea to test your UART wiring so you are able to send text to the console.This next step can be a bit tricky. You now need a paperclip or anything else you can use to short a switch on the MB. The switch is located near the large silver heatsink, named SW2. To reboot the system, short switch 1. Now this is the tricky part - quickly switch over and short switch 2 while spamming any key in the console. If you are lucky, you will see the uboot process has been interrupted and you now have an iDRAC prompt. It will look something like: iDRAC 7/8=>With the FAT formatted SD card loaded with the fimware image, run: util recover -emmc -from sd -f firmimg.d7 -noreset -clean  If you are successful, it should have erased the EMMC and installed the new firmware. You can now unplug the server when it's safe to do so and drain the power by holding the power button down for 30 seconds. Unfortunately if you were unsuccessful, you may have a bad EMMC chip, I have read that these can go bad from perhaps too many write cycles.When booting up, you may or may not have the lifecycle controller telling you an update is required or spit out a firmware error. This is ok, just reboot the server a couple times and it should return to normal. Boot into the lifecycle controller and click 'about' in the top right corner. Voila! The iDRAC firmware should now be up-to-date! To restore the iDRAC license, go to the Platform Restore section and import the license. You will need a USB stick with your exported license on it. You can now unsolder the BMC_UART connection if you wish and uninstall the SD Card from the iDRAC Card.Here is a labelled photo of the MB to guide you: Here are the forums that helped me:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvSDNAi39YY&ab_channel=JunctionRunner https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/bsou3n/dell_r520_idrac_7_swc0700_and_idrac8_prompt/ https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/a49b4y/r720_idrac_help/ https://winraid.level1techs.com/t/problem-dell-r720xd-idrac-bios-recovery/32658/95 Many Thanks!

"Hi,- T620 would get stuck on ""Configuring memory"" while booting. Never made it past that.- I then read about pressing ESC repeatedly while that message comes up and it actually worked.- Now my T620 would still show ""Configuring memory"" but after a minute it would say ""Configuring memory...Done"" and continue to boot.- It would now show a Memory Training Failure (RAM 1 and 3) while booting, but still boot. Only difference was that now I only had 48GB instead of 64GB, which made sense since my RAM is 8 x 8. - I was able to use the T620 just fine.- Installed a PCIe x 1 card into a PCIe x 16 (or is it x8?) slot and of course it would not work. The T620 would ""start"" but I would not see anything on the screen. I tried that twice and then took the PCIe x 1 card out again.- I switch RAM 1 with 2 and vice versa to see if the RAM is broken or the Motherboard.- Press the power button. Nothing. Took the power cable out, pressed for 10 seconds the power button, waited a minute, still nothing. The T620 makes no sound at all. ZERO. - Switched the RAM back the way it was, still nothing.- Checked the CMOS battery and it says 3 Volts, that it can't be that. I guess.At this point I have no idea why the T620 suddenly would not work anymore??? I heard no popping or smelled anything when plugging in the PCIe x 1 card because at the beginning I would that is what ""killed"" it. But I read online that people actually use PCIe x1 in x8 or x16 slots. So, no issue with that. I think.I only have one Power supply and its green light is on. What the heck would make the T620 stop working like that???Thanks.



					
						
					
					.","Navissa,
 
 
I would start out with first draining the flea power by disconnecting AC power cables and then press and hold the power button for about 15 seconds, once you do that open the cover and take the server to its minimum to post configuration, that is removing everything internally and externallly from the server, including mouse and keyboard, except the following :

System Board
CPU1 with heat sink (minimum for troubleshooting)
Single DIMM configuration with DIMM in socket A1 (preferably not one previously erroring)
Control Panel with cable (to power system on)
PSU (and for redundant PSU also the PDB/PIB)

 
After that power up and see if the no video issue is resolved. If so then add each of the removed devices back individually until the issue reappears, or all the devices are reinstalled without issue, this should help identify if there is a device causing the issue,
Now if the system doesn't start under the minimum to post configuration, then it is one of the devices I listed above causing the issue.
 
Let me know what you see.

"Hello!I'm trying to find a way to mount 2 of the T320 servers in a rack.

"Hello,I recently replaced a failing RAID 5 HDD(HGST) in a server from a supplier who gave me a Seagate ST10000NM018B HDD which is equivalent in specifications. The drive came online and the RAID rebuilt without a problem, but in the OSMA software it shows a warning because some of the information is missing(see attached pic) and the logs said something to the effect of ""HDD detected from unsupported vendor"". The drive status shows it being online, and these servers are close to end of life anyway and will be changed soon, is this something that I could safety overlook for now?



					
						
					
					.","Hi @Harry44,
 
If the drive is not a Dell certified drive, you may encounter such incident. This is because Lifecycle Controller/iDRAC is trying to communicate with the drive, but unable to retrieve Dell firmware data, the information displayed will be unknown/not available. The drive works, only informational data from the drive is not displayed. Since you mentioned that the servers are going to be replaced, I would say you can safely overlook for now.

					.","Hi, I can check if you can post the part number if the card you are using is compatible with the server. 

Make sure the adapter is securely inserted in the server’s PCIe slot and the cables are plugged in correctly.
In the BIOS setup, check the network adapter and enable or not.
Download and install the latest driver for the adapter.
Open Device Manager on the server and check if the adapter is listed. If not, scan for hardware changes. If the adapter is still not detected, it may be defective and need to be replaced.
Check the network cable connection between the adapter and the switch. A faulty or loose cable can cause network problems.""

"I am going in circles on this one. This is an older PowerEdge T320 with a PERC H310 control and iDRAC v7 controller. It has been in production and now we've taken it offline. We were going to set it up to do some testing but after deleting the RAID configs on both drives, we can't seem to figure out why we are getting this issue.In the PERC controller Adapter BIOS, I started by deleting both VD'sNext, I created new VD's and did a quick initialization on both.After I did that, when I look at the screen, it shows 0GB for total free capacity. I continue on and ESC out of that screen, reboot the serverI have attached pictures



					
						
					
					.","Hello jdb789,
 
Try these steps:
 
Give the system a flea power drain.
drain flea power (shut down, disconnect power cables and Network cables, hold in power button 20 seconds with cords removed).  After flea power drain, system has to set for 3 minutes for DRAC to reset without any power plugged in, then plug in NIC and power but wait 2 minutes before power on to give DRAC time to initialize.
 
 
Then boot into the LifeCycle controller <F10> and let it sit at the main page. The system either needs to be booted into the LifeCycle controller or an OS so that a driver will load and the DRAC will see the drives.
 
Check the DRAC Storage to see the drives.
 
If it does not show then give the DRAC a reboot and check again.
 
If it still does not show or as maintenance after they show, I'd recommend to check that the H310, BIOS and iDRAC are on latest firmware.

You can refer to the T150 user guide to enable RAID mode: https://dell.to/3Vwir0J
 
Once you enable RAID mode, you can access PERC S150 to configure RAID: https://dell.to/44vjUs8
 
Also, please note we are unable to assist directly in making new configurations, but we do have professional services which can help you to deploy the configuration you need. You may consider contacting Dell Sales department for a professional deployment if needed.

"Hey I was given a PowerEdge T630 server. I want to use it as a 2nd Windows 10 system to run my OBS streaming. I know overkill, but its what I was given. I have zero understanding of how a server should behave. I cant get a video signal out of it. I only have dealt with personal desktops which I'm comfortable with. I seek just how to install Windows 10 on this device and I should be able to figure the rest out. I see the back IO panel has two PCI slot bays for cpu1/2 and the center of the IO panel is labeled ""iDrac"" The VGA port located in ""iDrac"" does not show video, nor does the VGA at the front IO panel near the power button. . Let me know what I can do to help anyone make sense of this and what I may need to read to help myself. Thank you!
