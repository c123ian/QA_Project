"Hi,I haven't used my PowerEdge T620 in a year or so. When I just turned it ON, it says:Configuring Memory....and that's it. Nothing happens. It has been doing this for 30 minutes now. I remember having done something like this over a year ago and it did the same thing. I believe I waited for hours and then turned it off. Anyhow, does anyone know what the problem could be? I have 64GB installed and maybe I can take out some memory sticks and see what happens. If that is a good idea, I would need to know in which slots I then have to plug in the memory. The manual is a bit funkt when wanting to use 32GB with 8GB sticks... Thanks..","Hi, what Joey means is that if you have a pc, another topic should be opened for it.

It will not use the entire 16TB. It will only use up to the smallest drive capacity in the RAID5. So that would mean it would use up to 3725GB of the 16TB drive.

"Hi,Since nothing is working on my T620 and its completely dead, I thought about checking if maybe the Front Panel is broken, and reseating the cables might do something.

"I have a PowerEdge c6100 arriving soon.   It is a bottom end model with the Xeon 5520 processors. For the majority of what this server will be used for, that is more than enough. But for one blade the application in it will vastly benefit from a higher frequency rather than multi-cores. Doing a quick check I found that the 5520 is a socket 1366.  But when I check spec sheets for the server it mentions only the 5500 and 5600 series processors.  A little more digging shows that those 2 series were just factory options.   To my question: Is this server ~ONLY~ compatible with the 55/56 series processors or is it compatible with anything that fits the socket so to say?  Before I spend another grand on 2 CPUs with 3.4 Ghz I would like to know if they would work!~Thanks ahead of time, Tony.","Thanks for your question. It looks like the fastest option available is the X5672, a 3.2ghz option.  Further research shows the board will accept up to 95w processors only.  The 3.4ghz option you are referring to is a 139w CPU.   Regards,Geoff PDell | Social Outreach Services - EnterpriseGet Support on Twitter @DellCaresProDownload the Dell Quick Resource Locator app today to access PowerEdge support content on your mobile device!(iOS, Android, Windows)",
"Hi there,I've got a PowerEdge R320, great deal, £70 for an E5-2450, 48gb ram, dedicated enterprise iDRAC, both 350w PSU's and 3TB HDDs with a raid controller. However, I'm having lots of trouble when I'm running into updating the iDRAC firmware. I'm a bit of a neat freak so I'd really love everything to be as up-to-date as possible and I've gone through countless steps trying to fix this. Right now, It's on version 2.21.21. I haven't had any trouble updating the BIOS firmware but I have now rolled it back to its original 2.4.2 from having updated it to 2.9.0 . I have installed Windows Server 2012 R2 on it to try and get it to install from there but still no hope. I don't actually get that much of an error message when i do it, but its usually RED004. I've had a couple times where I've tried and the website comes up with iDRAC 8 instead of  iDRAC7. I have also tried hard resetting it with the command:racadm racreset hard -f Although this works to get iDRAC back into it's regular state after the firmware update going weird, trying again just gives similar errors and I have tried updating via the web page. This has been trying to upgrade to 2.30.30 and 2.65.65 I believe. Any help is much appreciated!.","Hi Joey,Today is the day it happened!I successfully updated the iDRAC firmware to 2.65.65.65 from 2.21.21.21.Firstly, I'd like to say thank you for your help in troubleshooting the situation and sticking with me throughout this nightmare.After having tried every method under the sun, iDRAC would still not update. Luckily, I found a great guy on YouTube (shoutout to him) going over his steps to fix a bricked iDRAC. Luckily, in my situation my iDRAC wasn't necessarily 'bricked'; iDRAC had no problem working even after the hundred failed firmware update attempts that I had tried. Although my situation wasn't exactly like his, the methods used to try and treat a bricked iDRAC managed to treat mine as well.So these are the steps I took to fix this problem (For an R320 or similar) Just to be said, I am not a qualified electrician. These are purely the steps I took to overcome this problem:You will need:USB UART device, one capable of 3.3v. (Cheap from Amazon)Soldering ironSD Card in the FAT format loaded with the firmware.d7 file in the root folder.iDRAC Enterprise cardSpare PC or Laptop with PuTTY installed.Make sure you export your iDRAC license. This can be done by the web GUI. If necessary also export you iDRAC settings as this will completely wipe all iDRAC configuration.On the motherboard there will be a BMC_UART port right next to the rear I/O of the MB. The connection pinout is: R320 (or similar) BMC_UARTFunctionPin 1 (Square Pad)Vdd (3.3v)Pin 2TxPin 3RxPin 4GNDSolder 4 jumper wires onto the board and connect them to the USB UART dongle as followed. Make sure the server is off!Connect to the serial port in PuTTY with your COM interface (if you're unsure what interface to use, check device manager) with a baudrate of 115200 using TELNET. Now you can boot the server. If those steps were successful, you should now see the uboot process of the server. If it has booted successfully, you should be greeted with a linux shell but in this situation we wont be needing that. Although it's a good idea to test your UART wiring so you are able to send text to the console.This next step can be a bit tricky. You now need a paperclip or anything else you can use to short a switch on the MB. The switch is located near the large silver heatsink, named SW2. To reboot the system, short switch 1. Now this is the tricky part - quickly switch over and short switch 2 while spamming any key in the console. If you are lucky, you will see the uboot process has been interrupted and you now have an iDRAC prompt. It will look something like: iDRAC 7/8=>With the FAT formatted SD card loaded with the fimware image, run: util recover -emmc -from sd -f firmimg.d7 -noreset -clean  If you are successful, it should have erased the EMMC and installed the new firmware. You can now unplug the server when it's safe to do so and drain the power by holding the power button down for 30 seconds. Unfortunately if you were unsuccessful, you may have a bad EMMC chip, I have read that these can go bad from perhaps too many write cycles.When booting up, you may or may not have the lifecycle controller telling you an update is required or spit out a firmware error. This is ok, just reboot the server a couple times and it should return to normal. Boot into the lifecycle controller and click 'about' in the top right corner. Voila! The iDRAC firmware should now be up-to-date! To restore the iDRAC license, go to the Platform Restore section and import the license. You will need a USB stick with your exported license on it. You can now unsolder the BMC_UART connection if you wish and uninstall the SD Card from the iDRAC Card.Here is a labelled photo of the MB to guide you: Here are the forums that helped me:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvSDNAi39YY&ab_channel=JunctionRunner https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/bsou3n/dell_r520_idrac_7_swc0700_and_idrac8_prompt/ https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/a49b4y/r720_idrac_help/ https://winraid.level1techs.com/t/problem-dell-r720xd-idrac-bios-recovery/32658/95 Many Thanks!",
"Hi,- T620 would get stuck on ""Configuring memory"" while booting. Never made it past that.- I then read about pressing ESC repeatedly while that message comes up and it actually worked.- Now my T620 would still show ""Configuring memory"" but after a minute it would say ""Configuring memory...Done"" and continue to boot.- It would now show a Memory Training Failure (RAM 1 and 3) while booting, but still boot. Only difference was that now I only had 48GB instead of 64GB, which made sense since my RAM is 8 x 8. - I was able to use the T620 just fine.- Installed a PCIe x 1 card into a PCIe x 16 (or is it x8?) slot and of course it would not work. The T620 would ""start"" but I would not see anything on the screen. I tried that twice and then took the PCIe x 1 card out again.- I switch RAM 1 with 2 and vice versa to see if the RAM is broken or the Motherboard.- Press the power button. Nothing. Took the power cable out, pressed for 10 seconds the power button, waited a minute, still nothing. The T620 makes no sound at all. ZERO. - Switched the RAM back the way it was, still nothing.- Checked the CMOS battery and it says 3 Volts, that it can't be that. I guess.At this point I have no idea why the T620 suddenly would not work anymore??? I heard no popping or smelled anything when plugging in the PCIe x 1 card because at the beginning I would that is what ""killed"" it. But I read online that people actually use PCIe x1 in x8 or x16 slots. So, no issue with that. I think.I only have one Power supply and its green light is on. What the heck would make the T620 stop working like that???Thanks..","Navissa,  I would start out with first draining the flea power by disconnecting AC power cables and then press and hold the power button for about 15 seconds, once you do that open the cover and take the server to its minimum to post configuration, that is removing everything internally and externallly from the server, including mouse and keyboard, except the following :System BoardCPU1 with heat sink (minimum for troubleshooting)Single DIMM configuration with DIMM in socket A1 (preferably not one previously erroring)Control Panel with cable (to power system on)PSU (and for redundant PSU also the PDB/PIB) After that power up and see if the no video issue is resolved. If so then add each of the removed devices back individually until the issue reappears, or all the devices are reinstalled without issue, this should help identify if there is a device causing the issue,Now if the system doesn't start under the minimum to post configuration, then it is one of the devices I listed above causing the issue. Let me know what you see.   DELL-Chris HSocial Media and Communities ProfessionalDell Technologies | Enterprise Support ServicesDid I answer your query?

On both versions it is just missing after installation. It was fine prior to this. We have tried to reach out to support and get no where with them. Does anyone have any suggestions of how we could reach to Dell to get them to include the Chassis Family? System InformationManufacturer: Dell Inc.Product Name: PowerEdge T30Version: Not SpecifiedSerial Number: XXXXXXUUID: 4C4C4544-0059-5710-8058-C8C04F313732Wake-up Type: Power SwitchSKU Number: 07C5Family: .. Thank you.","The latest 1.9.0 Bios still has the issue.  I started to investigate how to edit the DMI/SMBIOS table.  I found a tool from American Megatrends (Bios on T30 is American Megatrends, or AMI for short), it is called DMIEDIT.  When I open DMIEdit I can see the family name is set to HEX 90 1C.  Assuming these are hex for ascii characters, this means 90 does not exist and 1C is for a file separator, probably the reason for the issue.  Running DMIEDIT in the GUI you can edit the field, deleting the 2 characters and replacing it with a space (HEX 20) and pressing ""update all"" fixes the issue.  This only works until you reboot.  I created a startup task in windows to run the command line version on DMIEDIT to edit the field on every boot.  Something like DMIEDIT.exe /SF "" "" works.Kind of a hack but Dell has not fixed the issue in some time, not sure they ever will.FixBroke ",

"Hello,I recently replaced a failing RAID 5 HDD(HGST) in a server from a supplier who gave me a Seagate ST10000NM018B HDD which is equivalent in specifications. The drive came online and the RAID rebuilt without a problem, but in the OSMA software it shows a warning because some of the information is missing(see attached pic) and the logs said something to the effect of ""HDD detected from unsupported vendor"". The drive status shows it being online, and these servers are close to end of life anyway and will be changed soon, is this something that I could safety overlook for now?.","Hi @Harry44, If the drive is not a Dell certified drive, you may encounter such incident. This is because Lifecycle Controller/iDRAC is trying to communicate with the drive, but unable to retrieve Dell firmware data, the information displayed will be unknown/not available.

I continue on and ESC out of that screen, reboot the serverI have attached pictures.","Hello jdb789, Try these steps: Give the system a flea power drain.drain flea power (shut down, disconnect power cables and Network cables, hold in power button 20 seconds with cords removed).  After flea power drain, system has to set for 3 minutes for DRAC to reset without any power plugged in, then plug in NIC and power but wait 2 minutes before power on to give DRAC time to initialize.  Then boot into the LifeCycle controller <F10> and let it sit at the main page. The system either needs to be booted into the LifeCycle controller or an OS so that a driver will load and the DRAC will see the drives. Check the DRAC Storage to see the drives. If it does not show then give the DRAC a reboot and check again. If it still does not show or as maintenance after they show, I'd recommend to check that the H310, BIOS and iDRAC are on latest firmware. Dell -Charles RSocial Media and Communities ProfessionalDell Technologies | Enterprise Support ServicesDid I answer your query?

However these R340s are giving me problems as they don't appear to be compatible to anything.

"Yeah, don't listen to these other guys. They clearly aren't reading or understanding your question. Since you want to script it, you'll want to use racadm. The command is going to look like this:racadm>>get BIOS.MiscSettingsracadm get BIOS.MiscSettings[Key=BIOS.Setup.1-1#MiscSettings]AssetTag=ErrPrompt=DisabledForceInt10=DisabledNumLock=Onracadm>>set BIOS.MiscSettings.AssetTag 12345racadm set BIOS.MiscSettings.AssetTag 12345[Key=BIOS.Setup.1-1#MiscSettings]RAC1017: Successfully modified the object value and the change is in       pending state.       To apply modified value, create a configuration job and reboot       the system. To create the commit and reboot jobs, use ""jobqueue""       command. For more information about the ""jobqueue"" command, see RACADM       help.After that, you'll want to create a job like this:racadm jobqueue create BIOS.Setup.1-1 -r noneAnd then reboot the machine since most BIOS changes require a reboot. Not sure if this one does or not. You should test this first, of course.racadm serveraction powercycle How you wrap your script will be up to your scripting skills, preferred language, or environment. I use python with pexpect to simulate an interactive session. I use a lot of regex and catch expected output from racadm.

"Hello sci-hpc, I'm sorry to see the failed drives. I would recommend to consider if you have a backup and  if you need this data but do not have a valid backup that you should contact a Data Recovery company. Along with what Shine mentioned; the other very concerning thing I see is all the drives report 0GB in size (capacity).Do the drives spin up? Are there any lights lit on the drives? I can't imagine this happen with just a restart unless some previous issues have been occurring or you have experienced an issue that regular firmware updates could have mitigated. The system is very far behind in firmware and it could be some issue happened that may have been resolved with regular updates. I can't say for sure I'm just trying to give possibilities. Have you reviewed the iDRAC System Event Log for any issues before this happened? So after you consider the status of your backup you can try these steps below. I say to consider if you need data recovery as any troubleshooting could make it harder for data recovery if it is possible at all.  The array configuration is stored in two places; the drives and the controller.You may try shut down, unseat all drives, boot to the controller and  clear the configuration and shut down.Then seat all the drives and boot into the Controller BIOS to see if it imported the arrays or has a foreign configuration that you can import. Next steps you can update the system firmware and retry to import:You will need to step up the BIOS and iDRAC together iDRAC is thirteen revisions behind2.63.60.62, A0027 May 2019Do 7th2.61.60.60, A0005 Dec 2018 2.60.60.60, A0025 Jun 2018Do 6th2.52.52.52, A0006 Mar 2018 2.50.50.50, A0026 Sep 2017Do 5th2.41.40.40, A0014 Nov 2016 2.40.40.40, A0012 Oct 2016 2.30.30.30, A0030 Mar 2016Do 4th2.21.21.21, A0009 Nov 2015 2.20.20.20, A0010 Sep 2015Do 3rd2.15.10.10, A0025 Jun 2015 2.10.10.10, A0005 Apr 2015Do 2nd1.66.65, A0001 Dec 2014Do 1st1.57.57, A0006 May 2014 You are here   BIOS is seven revisions behind2.8.001 Oct 2019Do 7th2.7.027 Jun 2018Do 6th2.6.107 Mar 2018Do 5th2.5.417 Feb 2016Do 4th2.5.201 Apr 2015Do 3rd2.4.309 Oct 2014Do 2nd2.2.330 May 2014Do 1st2.2.206 Mar 2014You are here I can't tell about the PERC controller or the hard drive firmware.You can find the firmware here : https://dell.to/3jIShZB Dell -Charles RSocial Media and Communities ProfessionalDell Technologies | Enterprise Support Services#Did I answer your query?

But if I install all four modules, or even just three (in A1, A2, A3) the server appears not to boot - it sits at ""Configuring memory, please wait."" I haven't left it for hours to get past that, could it be that that's what I need to do?I'm wondering if this might also be a limitation of the processor. But the processor spec page seems to indicate that it supports three memory channels and much more than the 64GB I have.Some clarifications:I took out the modules which were in A1 and A2 and put in there the ones which were in A3 and A4. The machine still boots. So it does not seem that the issue is a faulty module.All firmware is at the latest version, to the best of my knowledge - with the exception of the BMC (BIOS is at 1.14).Does anyone have an idea what the issue might be?ThanksSolved!Go to Solution.",
"It turns out that my previous messages were on the right track. There was damage to the CPU socket, fortunately not of the replace-the-motherboard variety.I ordered a pair of CPUs (as I thought I could at least use all four DIMMs by putting two on each CPU). When I installed the first CPU I noticed something not quite right in the socket but ignored it at that point. Here's what I saw (I have circled the problem): But with the second CPU installed I was getting E1410 errors and the machine wouldn't boot so I had to take everything apart again and investigate. When I looked more closely I realised that this pin was out of place (I'm not sure if it was bent or just caught on the neighbouring pin) but I managed to get it back from the red position to the green position.That didn't solve my dual-CPU issue but I found that with one CPU, it would now see all 64GB, which it had not done before. So the original memory issue was apparently due to that pin above.Ultimately (for anyone who is interested) I did resolve the E1410 error - I think what did it was cleaning the second CPU socket by dabbing with a tissue moistened with isopropyl alcohol as Intel or Dell documentation mentions somewhere. As of now the machine boots with two L5640s and 64GB RAM (16GB in each of A1, A2, B1, B2), and I hope it will remain stable.View solution in original post",Is the M.2 on the T40s mainboard usable or has it been disabled in the BIOS?Solved!Go to Solution.,

I came into some ""luck"" and got a big case of white box Intel branded X710 quad port adapters. What I need is to update the firmware as they are quite old.

"Your post gave me just enough information to finally figure this out, so thank you.I was misunderstanding how EFI boot works in general (I'm a little bit TOO old school sometimes), and this got me over the final hump. The link was very helpful. I'm just so used to using the easy-button in the lifecycle controller, the non-standard approach was throwing me off.For anyone else reading, if you are trying to do non-Dell device firmware updates such as Intel NIC's in efi file format, go to the link above and get the ""shell.efi"" file, and put in in a directory on your fat32 formatted USB stick like this: /efi/boot/Shell.efi, then rename the file to Boot64.efi. When done, you should have  /efi/boot/Boot64.efi.  In addition, copy any firmware files or programs you may need into a separate directory on the same usb stick for use after you get the shell running.Plugin your USB stick to the machine you are working with and set your BIOS to boot UEFI mode, then on post, press F11 to enter the one shot UEFI boot manager. Once there, select your USB stick from the list, and the machine should boot into the EFI shell from the USB stick. After that, just google for the commands that the EFI shell will accept.Those were my steps used on R730, R730XD,, and R620 equipment. Also to note, I tried using the remote mapping of the USB stick using the iDRAC virtual media and updated 2 units remotely and it works fine. Just keep in mind that in the F11 boot menu, the ""virtual floppy"" will be the device you select as there will be no remote USB in the list. I would also not try to update firmware remotely unless you have a rock-solid and reliable network connection... any interruption in the flashing process can and probably will render the device dead.Thanks again Martin!View solution in original post","HelloI have server R640 with 1 processor, the server came with PCIe Riser Config 4, 2 x16 Low ProfileI have Boss M.2 for operating system then I installed then I installed additional PCIe NVMe deviceNow I want to install another additional PCIe NVMe.So, as per my understanding I can do that if I provided riser on riser slot 2A. am I right?Solved!Go to Solution.",

"TheMattHatter,  Would you confirm if you indeed ordered an OEMR T550, or was it to be a T550? I ask as OEMRs are purchased on a reduced cost on the OEM purchase program. Also you can't take an OEMR system back to Dell branded, so if it was intended to be an OEMR type it won't have the things you are looking at.So, if it was ordered incorrectly, or you received the wrong system type, you should work with your account team to get it RMA'd, as support won't have the same ability. Let me know if this helps.  DELL-Chris HSocial Media and Communities ProfessionalDell Technologies | Enterprise Support Services#Did I answer your query?

I have an R820 that I received second hand and it appears that the backplane was never used by its first owner, as none of the power/signal/SAS cables were connected, and the bays were all filled with blanks. The server would boot and run fine off a USB flash drive, but when attempting to connect a RAID card and make use of the backplane I continuously get stuck on the Initializing Firmware Interfaces screen.  Looking in the idrac logs the following exception occurs around the time in which the server appears to hang. In an attempt to remedy the issue I tried first removing the raid card, which allowed the system to boot normally. Replacing the generic raid card with an H200A yielded the same results as the other card, and the H200A was pulled from a working system moments before in an attempt to isolate the issue.  Furthermore, this only happens when the raid card is connected and a logical disk is configured. Destroying the array and attempting to boot allows the system to post and boot fine. I'm at my wits end on this one, as I can't figure out why a healthy raid array would cause a system hangup like this. All firmware is current to my knowledge, the lifecycle controller does not report any updates available. I unfortunately don't have any extra hardware to test with beyond what I have already done.  I have tried fully resetting the system to factory defaults using the built-in method on the lifecycle controller, as well as continuously trying to change settings and power cycling the system to see if I could find any conflicts within the BIOS. Another weird artifact I found during the process was that when trying to boot in UEFI mode, the raid configuration utility will never be loaded. Upon requesting the array config utility during startup, I get a message stating that the utility will load after firmware initialization is complete, but after initializing I get dumped straight into the boot sequence.  Happy to post any further explanations/logs/photos upon request.

Last week, the host migrated all of the VMs to other Hosts, and was inaccessible within VSphere. We rebooted the blade in hope that would correct the issue. The issue we are now facing is that during the boot process, the server is asking for a password. After much reading and researching, I think this to be a setup password of some kind. Unfortunately, this server was configured well before my time and I apparently do not have this password. I've tried many, many different ones I thought it could be to no avail. Default passwords included (calvin). Here is the screenshot of where the iDrac Virtual Console is asking for the password:I have read in the manual that a password can be removed by moving the jumper on the system board from pins 1 and 2 to 2 and 3, although I am unsure if this will reset that password in the screenshot. I tried this, but after putting the sled back in the chassis and booting it, the server never fully booted back up. I waited probably 10-15 minutes for the power button to stop flashing green before powering it off, moving the jumper back to the original pins, and booting it. The server did power back on and I was able to get to the iDrac again, but it still prompting for this password.We are working on gaining support for the server blade, but until then, I figured I would see if anyone had more information that could be useful to this issue.Last resort would be to reset the blade and reinstall the VMWare Host, but we are really trying to keep from having to do that.Thanks in advance if anyone has any ideas or recommendations!Solved!Go to Solution.",

Due financial reasons i currently cannot afford to buy another motherboard for the T610, on top on that there is none available anywhere within reasonable distance near me.I do however have the equipment and skills to fix it. After some fiddling around i managed to bring it back to life by removing the integrated nic IC (the bcm5709cc0kpbg chip got toasted as expected and it was shorting the MB).  While diagnosing the machine i had to do the minimal boot attempt several times, and after all other stuff got properly detected (all ram modules, the two cpus etc) after POST i get ""PCIe Training Error: Embedded NIC1"". All of the solutions i found online assume there's some pcie problems / incompatible hardware, but in my case it's obvious that the chip is not there. Is there any way i can boot the machine without the integrated NIC ?I have some options, like plug a random broadcom lan card into the PCIe and pray, or probably buy a PCIe card with the same chip, remove it from the card, ball it and replace it on the MB, but that's something I'd like to avoid at near-all cases, because I'm fairly sure there's other damages from the lightning (as expected).

According to the resources, this is an internal error and restarting the process does not clear the fault. Reflashing the iDrac firmware does not resolve the fault. Updates are taking place via the F10 lifecycle controller and connected via HTTPS to download the catalog. Catalog downloads but the proces fails on the subsequent step.The fault is reproduceable.

Removing the x710 card and attempting the update process however succeeds.It appears the Lifecycle controller fails with this NDC installed. Can Dell confirm please?RgdsPopsSolved!Go to Solution.",
"@DELL-Joey C, @DELL-Marco B, hiProblem identified and solved. However, for the life of me i cannot understand why.Both the 4P 10G x710 cards (68M95) were new. They were installed at the same time in both R630 units. Both Lifecycle controllers we then run independently for updates and both gave the same SUP0528 critical error. Installing the same rNDC NIC into a third R530 to serve as a testbed gave the same results. Initial suspicions were conflicts with other hardware but this did not turn out to be the case in subsequent tests. Attention was turned back to the rNDC card.Up until now, neither of the two rNDC NICs were used operationally. They were connected to the mainboard and powered up but no actual data was passed through the ports. Having then connected one of the four SFP ports to our switches and enabled it, inexplicably, the Lifecycle controller now does not flag the critical error. Turning to the second server and enabling a port on the second rNDC NIC and the precisely the same behaviour occurred.It seems that once the lifecycle controller downloaded the online catalog and proceeded to interrogate the hardware, it may have been reading a value from the x710 daughtercards that it did not expect - perhaps a register or a count (for data throughput, say). Whatever it is was cleared the moment traffic was flowing through the cards. Cold booting both units and the Lifecycle controller is able to now continue through to the firmware listing table.A very odd behaviour and one that was quite unexpected. It may be helpful to Teir 2 support or if this is passed on to the engineers. I am unsure how common this is with other x710 variants but there is evidently something with the Lifecycle firmware that it did not like until the rNDC cards were 'used'.CheersPopsView solution in original post","Hi guys,I'am currently looking for a script or API function that can download firmware updates for a IDrac.In our organisation we cant use the ""Dell Repository Manager"" and ""Dell OpenManage"", because both tools are labeld as a 'black box'.So I wanted to ask you, is there a script(i.e. on Github) or Redfish API command that can download firmware/driver updates?Otherwise I have to write a xml parser for the ""Catalog.xml"" to get the download URL's for the firmware/driver.best regardsSolved!Go to Solution.",

It clearly plainly can from the documentation and from the Poweredge website in the US that there is a rear bay that supports 2.5 x 2 NVME drives.  They cannot answer simple questions like where the Rearbay will go, can you use a rear bay and a boss card at the same time. I have asked this over email.When I asked to buy rear bay for nvme drives. they instead show me M.2 sized Nvme drives, which contradicts the statement made over the phone. They refuse to provide a quote, despite me simply asking for the rearbay configuration. This has gone on for weeks.

I also noticed a dialog that stated ""Ubuntu noticed a problem with a fwupd."" A couple of dialogs came up that said there were some problems. These seem to be software or firmware related. I attempted to set the fan control to low from IDRAC settings to no aveil. My next idea was to run the hardware diagnostics tool, I expected it to be like the Windows troubleshooter, but to my surprise it actually found some problems with the fans! I believe it might be a faulty temperature sensor causing the issue because I used lmsensors to get some temps, and everything was normal (32-34C). I attempted to disconnect the problem fan, but the fan speed stayed on 100%. I opened the case to see all 3 fans operating at 100% properly. From the pictures below, you can see that the server believes that the fans in slot 1 and 2 are not connected, but they are connected and running at 100% speed, it seems that it only detects fan 3.My question is: is there a temperature sensor embedded in the fan or is it seperate? How can I fix this issue?  Any help is greatly appreciated! Thanks for reading. Ubuntu 20 LTS Dell Poweredge R240Bios 1.2.0 (old) Solved!Go to Solution.",

"The T610 only has PCIe 4x slots (not open-ended from what I've seen, so you cannot put in a 'larger' PCIe card either).This means that physically you can put in a 1x or 4x PCIe card. However, Dell's server bios isn't really built around the idea that you'd add a videocard (that's more for a desktop computer). You may be able to get it to work, but don't count on support or assistance from Dell.A few notes: - there is most likely no power cable for a videocard in the server, so your videocard would need to be a model that doesn't require extra power.- if you have a DRAC, depending on the model DRAC, you'll loose (part of) it's functionality- you may or may not be able to disable the onboard videocard. This could cause a conflict or prevent the add-on card from working.If you're looking for a Dell tower system with dual processor support, I'd suggest to get a Precision Workstation T5500 or T7500. These are built to hold videocards and can handle dual processor and lots of memory. They are also available with a PERC6i (or at least the T7500 is) for full raid support.

"Hi,We have a DELL R910 server (Service Tag:<ADMIN NOTE: Service tag removed per privacy policy>) and have read some articles here about the problem ""E1234 Memory Riser Power Failure"" .  We have done some of the suggested troubleshooting.  On our system, here's what we've done so far:1.  Reseat the Memory Riser G and its DIMMs.  Same problem encountered.2,  Cleaned the Slot and contacts of the riser for any dusts or dirt.  Same problem encountered.3.  Swapped Memory Riser from  C with that of from G slot.  Same problem encountered (the problem is still on Memory Riser G slot)4.  Removed the Memory Riser from slot G so there's no Memory Riser installed on slot G.  Same problem encountered (the problem is still on Memory Riser G slot)So it seems that slot G on the System board unit have a problem.  I haven't replaced the system board unit yet (will be waiting for replacement).  Is there any other way to make this server boot up as we need this one badly.  Can we just disable slot G and place the Memory Riser on the other slot allocated to that CPU? (Note: we have 4 CPUs, so we have 2 slots of Memory Risers per CPU)Regards,Paolo.","Paw0702,Did the error happen to start during a power up or while it was running normally? If it did it on power up then we can try the following procedure to clear the issue.1.       Power off the system if it is not already powered off2.       Remove AC cord, wait for standby voltage to dissipate (10-20 secs or no LEDs visible and no LCD illumination)3.       Remove the G memory riser identified by the E1234 4.       Check the memory riser for any damaged components. Also, make sure the heat sink clip is installed correctly. Then leave the riser out of the system until step 10)    5.       Install a jumper on pins 5-6 of the jumper block labeled “J_DBGCPLD1” which is located near the iSCSI key connector (which looks like a phone jack) as seen below. There isn’t a jumper installed on this block from the factory, so you will need to borrow one from the  NVRAM_CLR/PASS_EN block or get it externally.7.       Apply AC.  Wait ~45 seconds to a minute for the iDRAC to be initialized. The front LCD will flicker momentarily and you can see the LCD interactive when it is initialized. The power fault message will be cleared from the LCD message queue.   8.       Remove AC, wait for standby voltage to dissipate (10-20 secs or no LEDs visible and no LCD illumination)9.       Remove the jumper (if you borrowed from the NVRAM_CLR/PASS_EN block, make sure it is replaced in the proper position) 10    . Reinstall memory riser11.    Apply AC12.    Power up the system Let me know if that resolves the issue. DELL-Chris HSocial Media and Communities ProfessionalDell Technologies | Enterprise Support ServicesDid I answer your query?

"I have installed the OS's on all four blades, but none have any networking. I believe I need to attach an uplink cable to my main network somewhere on the switch. Then do some configurations?I believe this is explained in Chapter 3 of the User guide under ""Configuring enclosure components"" . I tried reading about Fabric A,B and C but am confused by it all.What I want is for each blade to grab an IP via DHCP from the uplink cable to the main network. I then want each blade to be able to communicate with each other via the local 10 GbE network. I am not sure where to plug in this uplink cable? See picture below. In the future I may add one or two workstations to the switch . These workstations should also get a IP via DHCP from the main network and be able to communicate with the four blades via the local 10 GbE network. .","Finally got this resolved with the help of Dell support folks. Basically had to disable spanning tree on the VRTX switch. This is so that our corporate switch doesn't block it due to BPDU guard.The engineer from Dell said if we disable spanning tree then we can't do link aggregation ( use two uplink cables into the VRTX switch ).  I don't think we need that, so was ok with just disabling spanning tree.",

"Hello,Having trouble executing virtual machines on Hyper-V of Windows 2012 R2 Standard at PE R520.

"Hello.  I'm trying to figure out what is wrong with the PowerEdge 840 that the company I work for has had for the past 14 years.  It has served the company well without issues but right before Christmas it died.  It would keep rebooting and never boot to the OS.  I turned it off, waited and turned back on and would get stuck at ""Strike the F1 key to continue, F2 to run the setup utility"".  I like learning about computers so I volunteered to try and figure out what's wrong (doing so on my own time).  The company ordered a new server and is currently working off a backup.  The company doesn't have an IT person and from my understanding someone came to set up the server and that was it.  I don't know much about servers but would like to learn about them by trying to fix them.  Would greatly appreciate any insight on what's going wrong with this computer, and your time reading my description and questions.  Here's what's going on:When it is just plugged in (not powered on) the green and amber light would alternatingly flash.When it is booting up, Green light would stay on and Amber light would flashI took off the front panel and noticed that while it is booting, the C & D indicator light is amber.  A & B are greenWhile going through the POST process I would see the following:Foreign configuration(s) found on adapter.  Press any key to continue, or 'C' to load the configuration utility1 Logical Drive(s) found on the host adapter.1 Logical Drive(s) Failed1 Logical Drive(s) handled by BIOSIPMI Server Management Configuration Utility 1.5Baseboard Management Controller Revision 1.83Press <Ctrl-E> for BMC Setup within 5 sec.... - Nothing happens when I press Ctrl-EStrike the F1 key to continue, F2 to run the setup utility. - By pressing F1, it just reboots.  When I press F2 I get into BIOS.When I press F2, the IDE Primary Drive 1 is an Unknown Device - Is that because I have a RAID controller? All SATA ports are OffAfter I get into BIOS, on the front panel lights A, B, and C are green, but D would sometimes turn green and sometimes remain amber.  The main amber light is still flashing.  The user's manual for the 840 says an amber D light means that it's an ""other failure"" which does shed too much light on what's going on.If I do a warm reboot by pressing ctrl-alt-del and get into the RAID configuration utility by pressing ctrl+R, the C and D light on the front remains amber, but I'm able to get into the Raid controller utility and see the virtual disk management.  If the amber C & D lights indicate a possible expansion card failure, how would I still be able to get into the RAID controller utility?When I get into the Virtual Disk Management Utility, I see the following:   Which indicates that drives 1 & 4 are bad because they are missing event though they are connected to the cable that connects to the RAID Controller and the virtual disk 0 is in red.Does that mean that since there's a problem with the drives 1 and 4, that all data is now lost?Here are the other pics from the menus.At this point, I don't know what to do.  I don't know much about RAID other than the data is spread through the drives.  I've been reading up on it and supposedly I can remove the bad drive and rebuild the RAID through import, but would it work with 2 drives? I posted in General Hardware because I wanted to make sure my hardware was good before I try and tackle RAID rebuild.Thanks in advance for ANY assistance that can be provided!.","Looks like there is no issues with the server. 2 drives failed in RAID 5 resulting virtual disk failure.4 LED on the front indicate boot sequence.

"Hi I am trying to use the Xilinx Alveo U250 card with a Dell Poweredge R740 server.The card requires 75W of power from the x16 PCIe slot and 150W from the auxiliary PCIe 8pin supply. What is Dell Power Supply that I can use ?Will Dual Power Supply of 750Watt each suffice or I need to have 1100 Watt Power Supply ? How about if I want to use 2 Xilinx Alveo U250 Card, Which Power Supply is recommended ? Thanks   .","Considering what you want to do, I would use higher than 1100W but honestly, there are many components that might affect power consumption on server. Honestly considering that many parts of the server affect the power consumption, I can recommend you to calculate this. You can use this EIPT tool to help you choose the R740 from the rack servers and choose the parts from the right side and choose a PSU suitable for balanced power consumption.

"Hi all, i currently run a RAID 10 array in my Poweredge T420, and i would like to future proof my backup drives in the case of a drive failure, but i wasn't sure if my replacement drives need to be in a certain format for the swap to take place. I noticed there was a way to format drives as hot spares, is this what a replacement drive would need to be formatted as before it was popped in for the PERC to fail over a bad disks data from the backup, or can it be just as the drive is and the PERC will take care of everything? Thanks.","Hello the.mknabster, You don't have to format the drive before installing.You can do this while in the controller BIOS:Insert the drive, set it as Hot Spare.If it detects data on the drive it will show as Foreign.

"Hi all,I swapped storage controllers from H730p to HBA330 in a T630 after which the fan speed ramped to 55% PWM max (around 3k RPM). Server has been running for around a year with H730p and same HDD combination with no issues and near silent performance. No other hardware has changed.All firmware is up to date-BIOS is 2.13.0, iDRAC 2.82.82.82, HBA330 16.17.01.00Drives are 8 x Dell P/N W0VNC (TH0W0VNCSGT008BC00C8A00) with latest EA04 firmwareThermal profile is `Minimum Power`. Changing to `Default` doesn't change fan speed. Fan Speed Offset is `Off`. Minimum Fan Speed is `Default`. Removing all hard drives causes fan speed to return to normal.System has no active alerts. I've switched back to the previously working H730p but high fan speed remains. I've also unplugged all power + held power button for 20 seconds before powering on and gone through retire + repurpose wizard to clear all iDRAC and BIOS settings but issue remains.Any advice would be appreciated!.","As expected, this is a long standing issue with Dell firmware. From their own documentation for previous generation servers-A system configured as non-RAID has a higher noise level than a system configured as RAID. With non-RAID, the temperature of the hard disk drives is not monitored, which causes the fan speed to be higher to ensure sufficient cooling resulting in higher noise levelA bit of Googling shows the problem has only gotten worse with the next generation of tower servers having low quality, noisy fans and still don't allow a negative fan offset in situations like this.  ",
"I'm having a number of issues in replacing a failed drive in my server.My configuration is a little ""oddball"", in that I have two RAID controllers in the box - an H310 connected to two SATA drives in the 5.25"" ODD bays (RAID1/OS), and an H710P connected to the backplane, running a RAID6 array (Data). Recently, one of the disks in the RAID1 array was marked as ""failed"", and the array marked as ""degraded"". I removed the failed disk, and replaced with a near-identical unit (same size, type etc.)That replacement disk is now marked as ""foreign"", and I'm unable to find any way to add it to the array. Whether I use the H310 BIOS configuration utility or OMSA, it is always marked as ""foreign"", and I'm unable to utilise it in the array.I am unable to add it as a hot spare, or indeed do anything else with it. I'm beginning to think that I'll need to pull the original (still good) disk, and replace it with one identical to the ""new"" replacement I installed and completely reinstall the OS (which I'm obviously keen not to do). Is there any way I can ""force"" the controller to add the new disk to that RAID1 array, and thus have the array rebuilt?.","Hmmm...I may have stumbled on the answer. It appears that the ""new"" disk was being viewed as though it had a foreign (RAID) configuration on it. I was able to ""clear"" that foreign configuration, and the disk appeared as ""ready"". I then added it as a hot spare, and a few moments later, it's status changed to ""rebuilding"". Fingers crossed...",
"My R720xd is running all of the system board fans at full speed continuously.On powerup, the fans bump to high speed for a second, then settle down to reasonable speed, and stay at reasonable speed during POST, right up to the point where iDRAC initializes, at which point they all kick up to full speed, and stay there. From that point on, the fans go full speed. Nothing short of a reboot or shutdown will stop them.I'm not exaggerating even slightly. The fans run at 17,000 RPM, 24 hours a day. It's so loud it can be heard through the walls on the other side of the building.There is no OS installed on this machine.I've upgraded to the latest firmware, tried changing the performance profile in the bios, and tried the whole hold down the power button while unplugged thing as well.There's no possibility that it's overheating. Inlet air temp is 22 degrees, exhaust is 27, CPU temps are 35-40 degrees.I've found other references to people having similar problems with R720s, but there doesn't seem to be any single common cause for it.Any suggestions?.","Just wanted to follow up on the resolution to this issue. The firmware and hardware configuration were fine, the problem ended up being a defective motherboard.Dell sent a tech to replace the motherboard, and once that was done, the fans were running normally. The tech said that he's seen this several times, and replacing the motherboard is the fix.Hopefully this will help someone else.Thanks to Chris and the other folks at Dell for working through this.

HiTwo dell servers; Windows Server 2016 Standard DC (PE T440) and Windows Server 2012 R2 Standard member server.We have a peculiar networking issue. We started getting network connection issues. This happens for a few seconds and at no particular interval but let’s say once every one to two hours.Here is what we noticed;On member server the RWW connection will break for a few seconds and then restored.However we also get MS Access database crashes which complains that network connection was lost and to restart db to continue. The MS Access database was running from a shared folder on the DC. We moved the db to a shared folder on the member server but MS Access database still crashed.We moved both DC and member servers to a different switch. No luck. We reinstalled Windows Server 2016 standard on DC and moved back MS Access database to a shared folder on DC but still no luck and MS Access database still crashes.Could all this be due to DC hardware networking issues such as faulty network card or network cabling connecting DC to switch? At this point I am considering changing both DC’s network card and cable.Is there something someone can suggest to home in on this issue?ThanksRegards.,"Hi, that's really some peculiar issue I guess. The fact that the problem is happening from time to time and not in a certain pattern made me think that the problem was not caused by the server. Here I will suggest you to update NIC drivers and firmware. https://dell.to/3pQOyst If there is no error in the SEL log then I would think that it is more likely to be caused by DC networking. For example, I think it might even be the cables. Please update here on how it goes!Thanks,Erman ÖzkurtSocial Media and Communities Professional Dell Technologies | Enterprise Support Services Did I answer your query?

"I have eight M910 blade servers, and am quickly learning that the dual SD card readers, in these machines, don't last long.I need to replace these modules in two of my servers, and have replaced it in one, already.  When I look online, trying to find places to buy them, I see part number ""RWGG5"" being stated.  One description says that it's for the M910.  Another says that it's for the M620.  Another says that it's for the M620, but the picture looks different.  It shows the card with a USB port, which mine doesn't have.With all of this confusion, I just want to know what's compatible with what.  Will all of these work in an M910 because they all have this RWGG5 part number?I'd hate to start buying parts that I can't use.  So if anyone knows whether or not these are all compatible, I'd love to hear from you.Here are a few of the links that I'm referring to:https://www.ebay.com/itm/Dell-PowerEdge-M910-Internal-Dual-SD-Module-RWGG5-/312730856582?_ul=ILhttps://www.ebay.com/p/12006397241#ProductDetailshttps://www.techbuyer.com/us/rwgg5-dell-m620-dual-sd-card-reader-42243Thanks for your time, and for any help that you may be willing to provide..","Hello @evansste, I'm Joey from Dell community enterprise social support team.

"I have eight M910 blade servers installed inside of an M1000E enclosure. I installed them, one by one, while systematically installing an operating system on each one. Now, I want to network them all together. However, for some reason, I can get no more than five of them to run, at the same time.Once the M1000E has been powered on, I start pressing the ""on"" buttons on each of the servers. I get a solid blue light for each of them, until I push the power button on the sixth server. When I push the power button on the sixth server, the power button blinks a few times, and then stops. If I try to turn it on, via the web-based CMC browser, I receive a message which states ""Another action is being performed on this server. Try again"".I can wait, for several minutes, and try again. However, I continue to get the same result. The power light blinks a few times, and then stops. However, if I turn off one of the running servers, and then try to turn on server six, server six starts up, with no problem. Then, when I try to turn on the other server, that I just turned off, it's power button blinks a few times, and won't turn on.This strange phenomenon seems to happen to any of the servers. It doesn't seem to matter which ones get turned off, or turned on. However, I can only get five of them to turn on, with no problem. Whenever I try to turn on a sixth, the power button just blinks a few times, and then stops. If I try to turn on a seventh one, the power button just blinks a few times, and then stops.Based on this behavior, I began to think that, perhaps, all of this is due to insufficient power from the power supplies. I'm using three 110v power supplies. However, each one is supposed to be capable of putting out 1350 watts. With five servers running, the M1000E shows that the entire system is only consuming about 1600 watts. So shouldn't the three power supplies be capable of providing enough power to power all eight blades?Each blade has 128 GB of RAM and four E7-4830 processors.I'll probably end up buying more 110v power supplies, and try running the M1000E with a total of six, instead of three. However, because each power supply can put out 1350 watts, and I have three of them, shouldn't that provide roughly 4050 watts of capability? If so, then why am I not able to turn on another server when power consumption is at 1600 watts?I should also note that, while looking at power configuration options, in the web-based CMC tool, I checked ""Server Performance Over Power Redundancy"". Shouldn't that ensure that these three power supplies are being used to their maximum potential?I look forward to hearing any suggestions that anyone may be willing to provide. I really need to be able to run all eight blades.  Thanks for your time..","Well, as suspected, it turns out that adding additional power supplies, solved this issue.  I was able to install two more 110 volt power supplies.  After doing that, I've been able to boot up six of the servers, simultaneously, without issue.I haven't been able to test whether or not all eight servers will boot.  This is because my remaining two servers have other issues, and require more parts.  However, I have reason to believe that, once I get those parts, they, too, will boot.",

I searched for HP firmware and it appears that the drives are quite back firmware-wise so an update will probably be a good idea. Can the latest Dell firmware be applied?.,"HelloOur firmware is intended only for our drives. I don't know if HP has their own firmware or if they use Seagate firmware. If you try to install our firmware on a non-Dell EMC drive it will give errors.Dell EMC drives are not a requirement for our PERCs, but non-Dell EMC drives are not supported. If the drives are working without issue then I suggest making note of the firmware they are currently using. If you change the firmware on the drives or controller it may cause issues. When you use unsupported hardware you will need to perform your own validation with each firmware update.ThanksDaniel MysingerDell EMC, Enterprise Engineer",
"A friend gave me an R730xd. It was working fine before he brought it here (I was logging in remotely to it).

If it still doesn't post after that then try both power supplies, individually, in the power supply 2 slot. This will see if it may be an issue with a slot. If it still doesn't work then I would go through the minimum to post list and verify all of the devices are seated firmly, you can also try reseating each (if possible). Let me know what you see.  DELL-Chris HSocial Media and Communities ProfessionalDell Technologies | Enterprise Support ServicesDid I answer your query?

"I am trying to PXE boot off either integrated NIC2 (Broadcom) or Slot1-port2 NIC (Intel) on a R730xd. I have enabled the integrated NIC2 PXE boot in BIOS / Device Settings and everything works if I press F12 button on boot to enable PXE boot. The PXE boot initiated by pressing F12 always follows the BIOS settings correctly, PXE booting the NIC that is enabled.But if I enable PXE boot using IPMI or redfish, the boot is using wrong NIC. It is as if the BIOS configuration does not matter when PXE boot once was requested using IPMI or redfish - it always uses the same wrong NIC, no matter which devices have PXE enabled in BIOS/UEFI ""Device Settings"" or option ROM.I am booting in legacy mode, not UEFI mode. It works fine on older servers but only the 13th generation server has this issue. The same process works for older servers and all servers have similar configuration (legacy BIOS boot mode etc.)I have attempted both ipmi_boot Ansible module (which works right for older servers) and the redfish_command Ansible module. So when enabling PXE boot once using redfish, is there some way to force it to use ""NIC.Integrated.1-2-1"" or some other specified NIC?.","Managed to sort this out.In 13th generation Dell PowerEdge servers the boot order of NICs is taken into account when PXE boot once is enabled with IPMI or redfish. It does not matter which NICs have PXE enabled.This is contrary to older Dell servers where the same kind of boot uses the NICs that have PXE enabled. NICs with PXE enabled are favored over NICs with PXE disabled, regardless of the boot sequence.It is also contrary to the PXE boot once that was initiated with F12 key press.So this was fixed by setting the NIC I wanted to be the first NIC in the boot sequence, and it does not matter which NICs have PXE enabled.",

For more information, see the Mode-specific guidelines section.Up to three dual- or single-rank RDIMMs can be populated per channel.Up to three LRDIMMs can be populated per channel regardless of rank count.If memory modules with different speeds are installed, they will operate at the speed of the slowest installed memory module(s) or slower depending on system DIMM configuration.Populate memory module sockets only if a processor is installed. For single-processor systems, sockets A1 to A12 are available. For dual-processor systems, sockets A1 to A12 and sockets B1 to B12 are available.Populate all the sockets with white release tabs first, followed by the black release tabs, and then the green release tabs.When mixing memory modules with different capacities, populate the sockets with memory modules with highest capacity first. For example, if you want to mix 4 GB and 8 GB memory modules, populate 8 GB memory modules in the sockets with white release tabs and 4 GB memory modules in the sockets with black release tabs.In a dual-processor configuration, the memory configuration for each processor should be identical. For example, if you populate socket A1 for processor 1, then populate socket B1 for processor 2, and so on.Memory modules of different capacities can be mixed provided other memory population rules are followed (for example, 4 GB and 8 GB memory modules can be mixed).Mixing of more than two memory module capacities in a system is not supported.Populate four memory modules per processor (one DIMM per channel) at a time to maximize performance. Source: https://dell.to/3bAglGW  For PowerEdge R930 general memory module installation guidelines are follow: Populate DIMM sockets only if a processor is installed. For dual-processor systems, sockets A1 to A12, B1 to B12 and sockets C1 to C12, D1 to D12 are available. Each processor requires a minimum of 2 DIMMs, which must be identical.Populate all sockets with white release lever first, then black, and then green.Populate the sockets by highest rank count in the following order — first in sockets with white release levers, then black, and then green. For example, if you want to mix single-rank and dual-rank RDIMMs, populate single-rank RDIMMs in the sockets with white release tabs and dual-rank RDIMMs in the sockets with black release tabs.The memory configuration for each processor should be identical. For example, if you populate socket A1 and B1 for processor 1, then populate socket C1 and D1 for processor 2, and so on.Memory modules of different sizes can be mixed provided that other memory population rules are followed (for example 8 GB and 16 GB memory modules can be mixed).Populate four DIMMs per processor (one DIMM per channel) at a time to maximize performance.If memory modules with different speeds are installed, they will operate at the speed of the slowest installed memory module(s) or slower depending on system DIMM configuration. Source: https://dell.to/2YeaPa0 In case you have failed DIMM_A4, you need to replace it.

I have never been into overclocking so not quite sure how the multiplier/FSB speed thing all works. thanks Dan.","There were three models of the 2950.Only the 2950 MARK (III) could accomodate a quad core processor.  As long as the unit has the (III) designation in the top left corner, those processors will work within the unit.  If the marking is a (I) or (II), it woulnt work.  Below is a list of the supported processors for a 2950 (III) only. Xeon X5365Xeon X5355Xeon E5345Xeon E5335Xeon E5320Xeon E5310Xeon L5335Xeon L5320  Xeon L5310 Actually, per the Information update (available from Dell's 2950 documentation), <ADMIN NOTE: Broken link has been removed from this post by Dell> ""If the front of your system chassis is labeled with a “II”, your system is upgradeable to the 5100 series of dual-core Intel Xeon processors and the 5300 series of quad-core Xeon processors."".And then it says ""If the front of your system chassis is labeled with a “III”, your system is upgradeable to the 5100 and 5200 series of dual-core Intel Xeon processors and 5300 and 5400 series of quad-core Intel Xeon processors."".So, the II can already accommodate quad core processors, but only the 5300-series (the 5100 is the dual cores). The III can also accommodate the 5400-series quad cores (the 5200 is the dual cores for that generation).Member since 2003",
"We have two tower servers each of them has 8x2Tb HDD configured into RAID5. Recently due to temperature increase, 4 of them showed failure. Hence raid degraded, we had backup so no worry for that. But I was looking on disk one by one as PERC710 raid controller doesn't support any HDD without raid, therefore to check these drives I cleared the foreign configuration, and started to build Raid0 for each disk just to check which of them were working. But strange thing is that Out of 16 drive each one of them shows 'Ready' status as I plug them. But as soon as I configure them to build raid0 each of one them converts into 'failed'. So we are thinking that these disk are actually failed. But as I was googling these much disk failure, I got one of thread here, which said it is not really possible to failed even 2disk together, there might be some firmware or BIOS related issue.

What you'll need to do is shut the server off, remove the top cover, and then identify your PERC controller. It will have SAS cables connecting it to the backplane. You should also see another smaller cable and header. This smaller cable and header will be for the battery. You'll just want to unplug the cable and remove the battery, then replace it. You can then return to normal use. You might also check OMSA to see if it shows a learn cycle for the battery.#Iwork4Dell",

Can anyone tell me the End Of Sale For the PowerEdge R340?.,"Hello Joshrob321, @theflash1932 sums it up nicely here : https://dell.to/3EphI8A""No. It depends on the status of the development cycle for the next generation of servers and parts/systems stock levels.

For example, when the 12G systems began sales, you could purchase an R510 or an R520 for only a few short weeks before the R510 disappeared. The R410 and R420 were sold simultaneously for quite a while before the R410 disappeared from Dell's site.

The BIOS is already up to date in your post (6.6), so that much doesn't need to be worried about. For the iDRAC, I'd update to 1.99, then 2.80 (oldest 2.x version I'm seeing hosted) then to the current 2.92 version. iDRAC6's web update interface is for the iDRAC firmware only, it may also work for the BIOS (it's been too long since I've needed to test or check, so take this with a grain of salt). That said, with the BIOS already being up to date, that's a bit of a moot point. Your other items, like any PCI NICs or a PERC, wouldn't be updatable through the web interface, though. If you only have 1x of these systems, I'd go ahead do the updates this way. However, if you have a bunch of these systems, you can use Repository Manager to create your own firmware .iso.

The possible values for OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.674.10892.5.4.200.10.1.44.1 areother(1), unknown(2), ok(3), nonCritical(4), critical(5), nonRecoverable(6)We have other Dell PowerEdge servers deployed (albeit none are T440's), and the monitoring in PRTG of these servers matches what we see in iDrac, so I can't work out why this discrepancy.The T440 BIOS is up to date. There is a single fan in the chassis, which is reporting as operational and I can view the fan RPM, which fluctuates slightly when I refresh the page. I have also confirmed locally that the fan is spinning.PS: The server resides in Hong Kong (purchased in HK) but is supported from the UK. I spoke with a UK technician who said they can only go by what iDrac is reported, but did offer to replace the fan regardless of it working correctly.Has anyone else seen an issue like this? I could ignore the monitoring of the fan, but this seems a likely component to fail, so would prefer to keep monitoring it.Thanks in advance..","Hello, I can't really speak to SNMP, all the hardware monitoring I've done has been in the iDRAC interface. If the iDRAC is reporting everything as healthy, I'd be more inclined to think that there was some unexpected behavior taking place. Updating iDRAC firmware might be worthwhile. Flashing it would flash both the iDRAC and LIfecycle controller, and is a very big part of SNMP alerting.#Iwork4Dell",
"PowerEdge R7415AMD EPYC 7351PPERC H740P MiniRAID1 500GB SSDTrying to install Server 2016 on new Dell server. Used iDRAC virtual media and Lifecycle controller to deploy OS which completes without error.After install system reboots to blue Windows logo with black background and stays. Tried reinstall, but same issue. Left at the logo overnight.What should I do next?.",It was a driver issue. Using LCC deploy OS always resulted in the above problem because it includes the drivers during install.The fix was install without LCC and manually add RAID drivers during install. This allowed me to finish the install successfully and boot Server 2016.I assume the problem driver was the Matrox video driver due to the Windows logo being cut in half when it hung.,

"Hello Everyone,I have, in my homelab, a Poweredge R320 for more than a year now and it always worked well. Two days ago, the server rebooted suddenly with an PWR2402 error. After this reboot, the error disappeared, but the iDRAC interface was not available, neither by the webinterface nor by ping. (iDRAC 7 Express).After several tests, the iDRAC seems to be working when the server is powered off or when it starts for the first time after plugging power cords, but as soon as ESXi boots, the iDRAC interface is not responding anymore.I already tried to: - Change iDRAC IP and even put in a VLAN with only my PC and the iDRAC interface (to avoid a possible IP conflict). Same problem - Dedicate a NIC for iDRAC and another one for ESXi Mgt Network (all my VM already had a dedicated NIC). Same problem - Soft resetting iDRAC from ""Racadm"" utility in VMWare. - Update iDRAC and Lifecycle Controller to latest version available for my server (2.65.65). Same problem - Power off the server and unplug power cords for 1 min, while pressing the power button. iDRAC works until ESXi boots up - Boot a Windows PE on a USB stick. iDRAC works even after Windows booting.My last changes on this server was last month, but I don't think that's the cause: - Changing CPU to a E5-2470V2 - Updating ESXi 6.7 to 6.7U3, enabling SNMP on the iDRAC interface to monitor it.Do you think that a full iDRAC reset (and wiping my config) will be a solution? Have you ever heard about this problem? Do you have any ideas or recommandations?Thank you in advance for all your answers.Have a nice day..","Hello gabriel-d, Do you have a DRAC Dedicated port you can try? It looks like this could be due to an unsupported operating system. You indicate it does not occur when booting to Windows.  Dell has only validated up to ESXi 6.5 for the R320. I do understand you say you have had ESXi 6.7 working, however this is an unsupported OS and do not know what the behavior would be on this OS.Supported OS : https://dell.to/3d3lOaaVMware ESXi 6.5 If you roll back the U3 update does it run like it did before the update? If you don't have one, you may look at getting a dedicated port card. If this OS has a lock on the NIC ports then giving the DRAC a dedicated port may help. Pn#2827M - ASSY Riser Card, Server Chassis, Advanced Management Expansion Adapter , iDRAC Port Card Dell -Charles RSocial Media and Communities ProfessionalDell Technologies | Enterprise Support ServicesDid I answer your query?

The Lifecycle controller may be able to interact with the SUU, but I'm not certain this generation was capable of doing so. I don't believe that it could, but it's something worth double checking. Updating in-band won't be an option, because Debian isn't supported. If the LCC doesn't work with the SUU, then It think you would be best served by grabbing the Dell Support Live image, booting to that, and running individual firmware packages through there. The Support Live image is CentOS based and shouldn't get hung up on OS version scans. There is also the Repository Manager tool, which can be used to create your own bootable firmware update image, but there would be a fair amount of effort involved.

A maximum configuration will have a higher minimum fan speed.I don't have access to the exact settings the BMC is programmed for, but different CPUs can change the minimum fan speed settings. You might want to try reflashing the BIOS and BMC/iDRAC, and also clear NVRAM to make sure there is nothing corrupted in memory.

I have a Dell Poweredge R630 / System BIOS: 1.5.4 2015-10-02 that the warranty expired earlier this year. The server was placed into production in 2016 and is slated to be replaced in approximately 45-60 days.This server has an active alert:WARNING : Memory Device 1 A 2: Correctable ECC logging limit reachedIs this an indication of bad memory or a needed firmware update?I haven't had any success in finding this exact issue with this same server in the Knowledge Base nor in this forum so I am interested to find if anyone else has experienced this and what their solution was. Thanks..,"INdigital-Mike, The error is specifically referring to the fact that the logging of the dimm error is disabled. What I would do to isolate the issue is to clear the hardware log, then shut down the server and swap dimm A2 with another matching dimm in the server. If the error moves to the location you moved dimm 2 to then the issue is a bad dimm. If the error stays at the A2 slot after swapping the dimm then the issue is likely the board.  Let me know what you see.  DELL-Chris HSocial Media and Communities ProfessionalDell Technologies | Enterprise Support ServicesDid I answer your query?

"tired to search articles and documents but not sure about all the possible methods to update iDRAC firmware, especially after disaster.Currently I got poweredge R740 server with iDRAC9. The easiest way I know to update iDRAC9 firmware is via the WEB UI.

"Okay so to clarify before anything. This server is NOT being used in a business environment. Its literally being used as a home Media Server (yes, way overkill I know but i got it for free so whos complaining).Im currently using a PowerEdge 2950 as my home media server, I have just picked up its upgrade, a R710 Gen 2 and I would like to use all 6 bays at the front for hard drives that I can put media onto rather than 1 for the os and then all the rest for media.How would I go about installing an internal hard drive, preferably an SSD, inside the R710. I know it has a spare SATA Data port but I cant seem to see any spare power cables or molex cables like there is in the 2950 Gen 3 that I have.If it is not possible, thats totally fine but I would like to have installed an internal drive.I know there is a USB port but I am using Windows Server 2012 R2 (Probably soon to be Server 2016) but i am unsure if Windows Server can be installed to the internal USB.If you need specs, or the service tag i can give you that information!Any Help would be appreciated.Thanks,Arron.",Thanks for the clarification.

"Hi, I have a PowerEdge R510 with eight 4GB DIMMs. I want to add memory in the most cost effective way possible, but don't understand what I can replace where and have a balanced config. Can anyone help me sort this out?.","I think replacing two 4 GBs with 8 GBs will help enoughIt would be good to know how much total memory you are looking to have but 8x 8GB (total capacity of 64 GB) sounds economical.I want to get the most bang for my buck. 16 GBs seem a lot more costs per GB, From some of the posts I have read, one channel or bank or something can be a different size or something.16 GB memory modules do cost a little more but provide room for future memory upgrade. Yes, the R510 server has a rather unique memory population guidelines. For CPU A, it consists of 3 channels; CH0, CH1 and CH2. CH0 comprises slots A1 &A4 while channels CH1 and CH2 comprise slots A2 &A3 respectively. A similar pattern holds for CPU B. Refer to the diagram below:In populating memory, the memory in each channel has to match and being populated in the strict order of A1 (for 1 DIMM), A2 ( when 2 DIMMs are used), A3 and lastly A4. Note that the memory DIMMs on CH0 do not necessarily have to be same, they can be of different capacity with larger size module populated on slot A1 and the other on slot  A4.

"Hi all,I have R230 and currently my OS (ESXi) is installed on 3.5'' HDD, which occupies one hot swap slot. My plan is to move OS to either sd, ssd or 2.5'' hdd (instead of optical drive), so I could use all 4 hot swap slots for raid configuration (currently have 2 HDD in raid with perc H730).There is an info about IDSDM in R230 manual but I cannot find module that says that is compatible with R230. So my first question is can I use IDSDM with R230 for OS and if so which one?If IDSDM isn't an option or if you think that ssd is a better option, my second approach to this would be to install ssd with ssd to pcie adapter.Would this work on R230 ?And the last approach (that I can think of) is to install 2.5'' hdd instead of optical drive. Found one tutorial that this can be done on R330 (https://www.tachytelic.net/2019/10/install-ssd-optical-13th-generation-poweredge/), but didn't found any information about R230.So my third question is, can I replace optical drive with hdd on R230 ?.","If you have really a H730 in our R230  than create a Diskgroup of all of your DISKs and when creating the VirtualDisk(VD) just enter 20GB instead of 100% of capacity.  After that you can create a additional VD with the rest of all capacity.This ends in a setup with 2 LUNs and when install your ESXi just pick up the small one and when ESXi is up and running you have to create a Datastore on the large LUN. So ESXi and your Data is protected by the RAID5 and you will get the speeds of all of your spindels.When ever you need to reinstall ESXi your VM Data is protected because the both LUNs are separated.If you try to install ESXi 7.0 increase the the size of the Boot LUN from 20GB up to 140 because ESXi installer would like to create 128GB OS_DATA Partition. Another way... you can install ESXi on a USB stick. Some poweredge servers have a internal USB slot otherwise you can plugin the stick from the outside. But iam not a Fan of USB.Regards,Joerg ",
