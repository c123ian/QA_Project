487,"I have a Dell PowerEdge T430 server here that won't start up. Via the console, I can see it checks memory, then stalls on ""Loading BIOS Drivers."" Furthermore, the default IDRAC username and password isn't working (root/calvin). I've tried an NVRAM clear, as well as the password reset jumper. Attempting to reset the IDRAC module by holding down the info button has proven unsuccessful as well. BIOS version says 2.3.4 which appears to be old but obviously if I can't boot into the BIOS, I can't update it either. System had 1 x 16GB memory module that I've tried replacing with two other compatible RDIMMS. At this point I'm assuming the Motherboard is to blame but figured I'd check here for any other advice. .","Hello Devhux, Can you provide some history on this server;  Was it working and now it does not? If so what was done around the time this started? You can find the default iDRAC password on the pullout luggage tag on front of the server. You may be correct thinking motherboard.  Let me put these troubleshooting steps, most you have done already, to see if you completed them thoroughly and if you have just check it off and move to next one: drain flea power (shut down, disconnect power cables and Network cables, hold in power button 20 seconds with cords removed).  After flea power drain, system has to set for 3 minutes for DRAC to reset without any power plugged in, then plug in NIC and power but wait 2 minutes before power on to give DRAC time to initialize. Check results Clear NVRAM - there is a map under the lid to show the jumper location. Shut down,  Set jumper to the Clear position, power on and Post up to the jumper error, shut down and return to original location. Check results Minimum to post testingThe minimum components to allow the Dell™ PowerEdge™ T430 to complete POST are: System boardOne power supply unit (and for redundant PSU also the PIB)CPU1 with heat sink (minimum for troubleshooting)Single DIMM configuration with DIMM in socket A1Control panel with cable (to power system on)  Remove anything not on the list: DVD, Hard drives, PERC controller, backplane, NDC, network card, any pcie cards… While in there check for any bent pins on DIMM slots, CPU sockets, any other connectors If it does not post then the issue is with one of those components. If you get successful POST, put things back a little at a time until you find the faulting component. Then update BIOS when you are able to post successfully.Dell Server BIOS PowerEdge R430/R530/T430 Version 2.13.0https://dell.to/2WOkRxE Dell -Charles RSocial Media and Communities ProfessionalDell Technologies | Enterprise Support ServicesDid I answer your query?

Went a look at the user guide, yeah, my mistake. It cannot be change to LOM2, only to failover to LOM2. After further search, seems that the OS need to do network teaming in order for the iDRAC shared LOM to work with OS. Page 34:  https://dell.to/31Gyz7M I'm not familiar with Truenas OS network teaming, maybe you want to research on that. DELL-Joey CSocial Media and Communities ProfessionalDell Technologies | Enterprise Support ServicesDid I answer your query?

511,"I recently purchased a Dell PowerEdge R720 and ended up receiving an OEM XL R720.  I have three other standard R720s, but this is my first encounter with an OEM XL system.  I'm debating if I should send the unit back as the fact it was an OEM XL wasn't disclosed.  Before I do that though, I want to better understand what I'm dealing with here.Is an OEM XL R720 compatible with standard Dell firmware/BIOS and associated software?Is the hardware potentially modified or substituted by Dell for a specific customer's needs?Is there a reason why a standard R720 would be preferable over an OEM XL system?I haven't been able to find much documentation on the topic, so any help will be greatly appreciated.Thanks!.","Hi @R320Cluster, OEM PowerEdge usually cater to companies that they would like to have their own brand, customize firmware to their environment requirement and customized configuration. I'll basically go straight to you questions:Is an OEM XL R720 compatible with standard Dell firmware/BIOS and associated software?No, they are not compatible with standard firmware and BIOS. Software like OMSA, OME and other applications are subject to their compatibility. Will need to check on each of the application user guide for it. Is the hardware potentially modified or substituted by Dell for a specific customer's needs?Yes, they are customized for each customer's needs. Though, we're unsure what specific customer requirements, only the customer and the Dell software engineer works together to obtain newer releases. Is there a reason why a standard R720 would be preferable over an OEM XL system?Generally, that will depend on individuals. Standard servers will have standard support. OEM XL will need specific support. Support in a sense of firmware updates and hardware compatibility.Here's a simple article back in 2011 on OEM branding: https://dell.to/3BYL77F Let me know if that clears the air for you.DELL-Joey CSocial Media and Communities ProfessionalDell Technologies | Enterprise Support ServicesDid I answer your query?

Support Overview Services Support Subscribe Blog Announcing the OEM XL program: Balancing stability with innovation By Franklin Flint | May 11, 2011 November 12, 2020 Dell OEM Solutions exists to meet the unique needs of OEM customers who build their hardware solutions on high quality gear from Dell. Since our inception over 10 years ago we have created programs, services offerings, new hardware offerings, and even influenced the design of mainstream platforms to better fit the needs of our OEM customers. The first big OEM program we offered was the OEM-Ready hardware de-branding program where we removed the Dell brand to simplify our customers’ ability to self-brand the hardware to their needs. The amazing adoption of OEM-Ready has enabled us to expand that offering to most of our rack mount PowerEdge Servers, JBOD storage arrays, and certain client products. Solving the branding needs was just the first step. As our OEM business grew, it became clear that our OEM customers had a need to better control their solution component stability and improve their lifecycle development time. In general they asked that we help them ensure the platform they choose on day one is available with: No changes to the major components, like CPU and motherboard. Clear advanced notifications on changes to minor components like BIOS, Firmware, hard drives, RAM, etc. Assurance that the systems sold can be repaired in the field for 5 years, and sometimes longer, to ensure the application being deployed will meet the lifecycle needs of the end user. Longer sales life to allow for ample time to develop on and release on the replacement platform. With these requirements in mind, Dell OEM Solutions developed and soft-launched the OEM XL program in March, 2010, to meet our customers’ needs. Over the past year we have refined the OEM XL program to include the most popular platforms for these features and to clearly define exactly what can be offered while still providing all the benefits our best in class hardware and services can offer. This month we are formally announcing the OEM XL program with the following capabilities: Stability : No changes to high impact components, controlled change on moderate impact components, and managed change on low impact components during the lifespan of a platform. Visibility : OEM XL products include accurate and reliable updates on changes which might occur during the sales life in addition to the already excellent processes available to OEM customers on other platforms. Support : To ensure all installations are available and running for the desired production life of the platform Dell OEM XL products can be purchased with 5 years or longer field warranty contracts. Longevity : Sales life extending 12 months after the launch of the next generation platform to allow for development and testing of replacement solutions. We are excited about this program and are confident we have met the needs of most of our OEM customers to manage change and lifecycles on their OEM hardware solutions. If you want to learn more about the OEM XL program and how Dell OEM Solutions can help you deliver cutting edge innovation to your customers, please fill out an engagement form . Also, make sure to follow us on twitter and register for blog notification to stay updated on the OEM XL program and more.

454,"We recently purchased a PowerEdge R7515 with a PERC H740P Mini RAID controller and a 24 bay chassis configured so that slots 12-23 can be used with U.2 NVME disks.In addition to this we purchased 10x DXD9H disk caddies, 6x Samsung SATA SSDs and 4x Samsung PM9A3 U.2 disks from another company. The DXD9H caddies work fine for inserting the Samsung SATA SSDs but they are not quite right for the PM9A3 U.2 disks. The PM9A3 disks fit into the caddies fine and you can insert the disks most of the way into the (U.2) bays but they don't connect to the interfaces when in the DXD9H caddies because the connectors are not aligned correctly by a few mm. We have been able to attach, use and boot from all 4 U.2 disks when they are connected without housing them in caddies so the drives are electronically compatible and the disks work but they're not very secure having them inserted loose like that.Is there a special caddy for using U.2 disks in a R7515 or maybe there is some kind of adapter required to house disks like these? .","Hello danboid, I don't have an exhaustive list, but I was able to verify this Customer Kit for NVMe drive , in the R7515, does have that carrier: Part# 400-BKFR - Dell EMC PowerEdge Express Flash Ent NVMe Read Intensive U.2 Gen4 3.84TB with Carrierhttps://dell.to/3DMu9KUIt not stated on that page, but drill down of the part shows it contains this carrier : DXD9H - ASSY Carrier HDD/SSD, 2.5 Inch, Metal  Are you able to verify your backplane is seated correctly?Maybe remove and reinstall - Page 51 - https://dell.to/3xq7p17  Can you provide some pictures with it in the caddie and the alignment issue? Dell -Charles RSocial Media and Communities ProfessionalDell Technologies | Enterprise Support ServicesDid I answer your query?

505,Can anyone tell me the End Of Sale For the PowerEdge R340?.,"Hello Joshrob321, @theflash1932 sums it up nicely here : https://dell.to/3EphI8A""No. It depends on the status of the development cycle for the next generation of servers and parts/systems stock levels. Some systems are longer-lived in the marketing phase than others. For example, when the 12G systems began sales, you could purchase an R510 or an R520 for only a few short weeks before the R510 disappeared. The R410 and R420 were sold simultaneously for quite a while before the R410 disappeared from Dell's site. Just assume that once a new generation is ANNOUNCED that the life of the model being replaced could end very soon."" We are still selling 14Gen R340 even though 15Gen R450, for example, are currently selling also.https://dell.to/3Ep4ust Dell -Charles RSocial Media and Communities ProfessionalDell Technologies | Enterprise Support ServicesDid I answer your query?

1,"Hi,I haven't used my PowerEdge T620 in a year or so. When I just turned it ON, it says:Configuring Memory....and that's it. Nothing happens. It has been doing this for 30 minutes now. I remember having done something like this over a year ago and it did the same thing. I believe I waited for hours and then turned it off. Anyhow, does anyone know what the problem could be? I have 64GB installed and maybe I can take out some memory sticks and see what happens. If that is a good idea, I would need to know in which slots I then have to plug in the memory. The manual is a bit funkt when wanting to use 32GB with 8GB sticks... Thanks..","Hi, what Joey means is that if you have a pc, another topic should be opened for it. For T620, I think it's in no post status.You can make drain power at first as a few steps you can try.Drain server flea power and check for any error messages during POST1) Remove any external peripherals from the server2) Turn system off and remove input power from the server3) Hold down power button for 10 seconds with power unplugged and then wait for one minute4) Re-apply input power and turn system on. Please try to min2post https://dell.to/3IIIkVOOne processor (CPU) in socket processor 1One memory module (DIMM) in socket A1One power supply unithttps://dell.to/3IM2lebSystem Board Jumper SettingsFor information on resetting the password jumper to disable a password, see Disabling A Forgotten Password.Table 1.

5,"Greetings!I am adding 16TB x 1 SATA HDD hot-plug hard disk to add more storage in our Dell PowerEdge T440 Server, that currently has RAID-1 (446GB x 2 SATA SSD) and RAID-5 (3725GB x 4 SATA HDD).  The added new HDD is in the current state Ready (not Online).  Question:  What is the best way to add this additional hard disk?  Can I add this to the existing RAID-5?  Or, will it be better to create a new Virtual Disk?  I am okay either way and I really appreciated any guidance.Thanks a  lot for your help!current physical disks statuscurrent physical virtual status.","Hello ebk528, It is always recommended you verify the status of your backup before doing any changes on the array(s). You could create a single drive RAID 0 to get the full capacity. You could also do Online Capacity Expansion (OCE) to add it to the RAID5. It will not use the entire 16TB. It will only use up to the smallest drive capacity in the RAID5. So that would mean it would use up to 3725GB of the 16TB drive. The rest is unusable.If you do the OCE, make sure you beginning and ending RAID level is RAID 5. How to reconfigure an online virtual disk :https://dell.to/3OUuxiG Dell -Charles RSocial Media and Communities ProfessionalDell Technologies | Enterprise Support ServicesDid I answer your query?

Summary: How to reconfigure an online virtual disk in ways that expand its capacity and/or changes its RAID level. Article Content Article Properties Rate This Article This article may have been automatically translated. If you have any feedback regarding its quality, please let us know using the form at the bottom of this page. Article Content Symptoms Note: This article is part of the Server Tutorials: "" Raid and Disks "" available here . An online virtual disk can be reconfigured in ways that expand its capacity and or changes its RAID level. Note: The controller changes the write cache policy of all virtual disks undergoing an RLM/OCE to Write-Through until the RLM/OCE is complete. Note: Spanned virtual disks such as RAID 50, and 60 cannot be reconfigured. Reconfiguring virtual disks typically impacts disk performance until the reconfiguration operation is complete. We recommend performing a backup before any RAID Reconfiguration. Online Capacity Expansion (OCE) can be done in two ways: If there is a single virtual disk in a disk group and free space is available. The virtual disk’s capacity can be expanded within that free space. If a virtual disk is created and it does not use the maximum size of the disk group, free space is available. Free space can also be available when a disk group’s physical disks are replaced with larger disks using the Replace Member feature. A virtual disk's capacity can also be expanded by performing an OCE operation to add more physical disks. RAID Level Migration (RLM) refers to changing a virtual disk’s RAID level. Both RLM and OCE can be done simultaneously so that a virtual disk can simultaneously have its RAID level that is changed and its capacity increased. When an RLM/OCE operation is complete, a reboot is not required. The source RAID level column indicates the virtual disk RAID level before the RLM/OCE operation. The target RAID level column indicates the RAID level after the RLM/OCE operation. Note: This feature is available since iDRAC9 generation if you have a supported PERC(9 and 10). To extend a virtual disk, add similar disk in the backplane and then reconfigure the virtual disk. Reconfiguration can be done by following these steps: In the PERC BIOS menu (at startup), once the Virtual Disk is selected press F2 , then Reconfigure . In OMSA (Openmanage Server Administrator) , System > Storage > PERC > Virtual Disk > select Reconfigure in the dropdown menu. Possible RAID Level Migrations: Source RAID Target RAID Required Number of PDs(Beginning) Number of PDs(End) Capacity Expansion Possible Description RAID 0 RAID 0 1 2 or more Yes Increases capacity RAID 0 RAID 1 1 2 No Converts nonredundant virtual disk into a mirrored virtual disk by adding one disk RAID 0 RAID 5 1 or more 3 or more Yes At least one drive needs to be added for distributed parity data. RAID 0 RAID 6 1 or more 4 or more Yes At least two drives need to be added for dual distributed parity data. RAID 1 RAID 0 2 2 or more Yes Removes redundancy while increasing capacity RAID 1 RAID 5 2 3 or more Yes Maintains redundancy while doubling capacity RAID 1 RAID 6 2 4 or more Yes Two drives are required to be added for distributed parity data. RAID 5 RAID 0 3 or more 3 or more Yes Converts to a nonredundant virtual disk and reclaims disk space that is used for distributed parity data RAID 5 RAID 5 3 4 or more Yes Increases capacity by adding disks RAID 5 RAID 6 3 or more 4 or more Yes At least one drive needs to be added for dual distributed parity data. RAID 6 RAID 0 4 or more 4 or more Yes Converting to a nonredundant virtual disk and reclaiming disk space that is used for distributed parity data. RAID 6 RAID 5 4 or more 4 or more Yes Removing one set of parity data and reclaiming disk space that is used for it. RAID 6 RAID 6 4 5 or more Yes Increases capacity by adding disks RAID 10 RAID 10 Less than 32 32 Yes Increases capacity by adding disks Cause Note: If the controller already contains the maximum number of virtual disks, you cannot perform a RAID level migration or capacity expansion on any virtual disk.

For more information, see the Mode-specific guidelines section.Up to three dual- or single-rank RDIMMs can be populated per channel.Up to three LRDIMMs can be populated per channel regardless of rank count.If memory modules with different speeds are installed, they will operate at the speed of the slowest installed memory module(s) or slower depending on system DIMM configuration.Populate memory module sockets only if a processor is installed. For single-processor systems, sockets A1 to A12 are available. For dual-processor systems, sockets A1 to A12 and sockets B1 to B12 are available.Populate all the sockets with white release tabs first, followed by the black release tabs, and then the green release tabs.When mixing memory modules with different capacities, populate the sockets with memory modules with highest capacity first. For example, if you want to mix 4 GB and 8 GB memory modules, populate 8 GB memory modules in the sockets with white release tabs and 4 GB memory modules in the sockets with black release tabs.In a dual-processor configuration, the memory configuration for each processor should be identical. For example, if you populate socket A1 for processor 1, then populate socket B1 for processor 2, and so on.Memory modules of different capacities can be mixed provided other memory population rules are followed (for example, 4 GB and 8 GB memory modules can be mixed).Mixing of more than two memory module capacities in a system is not supported.Populate four memory modules per processor (one DIMM per channel) at a time to maximize performance. Source: https://dell.to/3bAglGW  For PowerEdge R930 general memory module installation guidelines are follow: Populate DIMM sockets only if a processor is installed. For dual-processor systems, sockets A1 to A12, B1 to B12 and sockets C1 to C12, D1 to D12 are available. Each processor requires a minimum of 2 DIMMs, which must be identical.Populate all sockets with white release lever first, then black, and then green.Populate the sockets by highest rank count in the following order — first in sockets with white release levers, then black, and then green. For example, if you want to mix single-rank and dual-rank RDIMMs, populate single-rank RDIMMs in the sockets with white release tabs and dual-rank RDIMMs in the sockets with black release tabs.The memory configuration for each processor should be identical. For example, if you populate socket A1 and B1 for processor 1, then populate socket C1 and D1 for processor 2, and so on.Memory modules of different sizes can be mixed provided that other memory population rules are followed (for example 8 GB and 16 GB memory modules can be mixed).Populate four DIMMs per processor (one DIMM per channel) at a time to maximize performance.If memory modules with different speeds are installed, they will operate at the speed of the slowest installed memory module(s) or slower depending on system DIMM configuration. Source: https://dell.to/2YeaPa0 In case you have failed DIMM_A4, you need to replace it. It is important also to isolate memory issue before replacing. Not always errors on DIMMs indicates that DIMM needs to be replaced.

476,"I recently replaced a failed drive in a RAID 5 array on an R720; I realized today that it was still in a degraded state as the replacement drive, although online, hadn't been brought into the array.I set it to do so, and I see the scheduled job in the job queue in the iDrac; however, it has been there for hours and no progress. There are two questions - with the hot swap capabilities, my understanding was the array would automatically rebuild - I'd like to understand why it didn't. Secondly, what do I need to do to cause the scheduled job to run? It shows ""Scheduled 0%"" and in the details, ""Start time: now"" and ""Task successfully scheduled"". The R720 is running version 2.65.65.65 of the iDrac. Thanks,Des .","Hello Des, I'm sorry you faced with this issue.

556,"Hello Everyone,I have, in my homelab, a Poweredge R320 for more than a year now and it always worked well. Two days ago, the server rebooted suddenly with an PWR2402 error. After this reboot, the error disappeared, but the iDRAC interface was not available, neither by the webinterface nor by ping. (iDRAC 7 Express).After several tests, the iDRAC seems to be working when the server is powered off or when it starts for the first time after plugging power cords, but as soon as ESXi boots, the iDRAC interface is not responding anymore.I already tried to: - Change iDRAC IP and even put in a VLAN with only my PC and the iDRAC interface (to avoid a possible IP conflict). Same problem - Dedicate a NIC for iDRAC and another one for ESXi Mgt Network (all my VM already had a dedicated NIC). Same problem - Soft resetting iDRAC from ""Racadm"" utility in VMWare. - Update iDRAC and Lifecycle Controller to latest version available for my server (2.65.65). Same problem - Power off the server and unplug power cords for 1 min, while pressing the power button. iDRAC works until ESXi boots up - Boot a Windows PE on a USB stick. iDRAC works even after Windows booting.My last changes on this server was last month, but I don't think that's the cause: - Changing CPU to a E5-2470V2 - Updating ESXi 6.7 to 6.7U3, enabling SNMP on the iDRAC interface to monitor it.Do you think that a full iDRAC reset (and wiping my config) will be a solution? Have you ever heard about this problem? Do you have any ideas or recommandations?Thank you in advance for all your answers.Have a nice day..","Hello gabriel-d, Do you have a DRAC Dedicated port you can try? It looks like this could be due to an unsupported operating system. You indicate it does not occur when booting to Windows.  Dell has only validated up to ESXi 6.5 for the R320. I do understand you say you have had ESXi 6.7 working, however this is an unsupported OS and do not know what the behavior would be on this OS.Supported OS : https://dell.to/3d3lOaaVMware ESXi 6.5 If you roll back the U3 update does it run like it did before the update? If you don't have one, you may look at getting a dedicated port card. If this OS has a lock on the NIC ports then giving the DRAC a dedicated port may help. Pn#2827M - ASSY Riser Card, Server Chassis, Advanced Management Expansion Adapter , iDRAC Port Card Dell -Charles RSocial Media and Communities ProfessionalDell Technologies | Enterprise Support ServicesDid I answer your query?

The spec says there is a ""1x8 pci-e (x16 connector)"" or in another spec says ""x8 link in x16 slot"". I am not sure how to interpret this. Is this a pci-e x8 or x16 finally? Q2: I talked with Dell technician. He says that Dell does not support gpu cards on this server. But my question is about the possibility. Is it possible to install NVidia GTX 1080ti? Has anybody tried that? Solved!

We can add that it *supports* x16 devices but works at half speed (x8).

Here's the T140's specification page: https://dell.to/3qrct0z . The PSU has only 365W power, you might need to check on the GPU's requirement for power consumption. There is no upgrades for T140's PSU power, 365W is all it has. Let me know if you have any questions.

For the record, I list the important factors that one should consider when installing a video card on PowerEdge T140: 1- The PSU is limited to 365W. So, any video card that needs additional power needs to change the PSU! Otherwise, one has to compromise using fewer devices (fewer hard drives). 2- The mainboard designed in a way that a video card with a length of more than 21-22cm cannot be installed. Because, the only 16x connector PCI-e is right in front of the battery! This is the engineering limitation! That's why only mini versions of video cards can be physically installed. 3- The 16x connector PCI-e has indeed 8x connection to the cpu. As a result, any 16x video card performs at half of its performance. 0 Kudos Reply Accept as Solution explo2006 2 Bronze 3176 ‎08-02-2021 06:01 AM Mark as New Bookmark Subscribe Mute Permalink Print Report Inappropriate Content Hi have read your post i have a dell t140 server and iwant to install a vga card.

494,I have just bought a Dell poweredge t310 from eBay. I am really struggling to get the operating system to install. The server does boot from my 2012 R2 installation Media I then going to troubleshooting and try to restore the image and it tells me there's not enough disk space I suspect it's trying to install all to the USB drive where the image resides if I drop to a dos prompt the C drive is showing as as the USB drive and not the 2 TB drive that's in there. If I just go for a clean install it tells me it's missing drivers but doesn't tell me which drivers which is really helpful. I suspect I have to set up a ram drive and put the the drivers ISO onto there. Does anyone know where I can find a step-by-step installation guide please.,"Hello grahambrown, Thank you for the update. The S100 is not supported in WS2012R2. Use this option -  Convert PERC S100 into on-board SATA controller Note: No data is migrated and this is not a replacement of PERC S100 solution. Data needs to be backed up before following the below steps.     Power on the server and press F2 to enter the BIOS settings.    Enter the BIOS setup -> SATA settings option and change it to ATA or ACHI mode whichever is available. Refer Figure-1.    Save and Exit the setup.    Boot from the Microsoft Windows Server 2012 DVD and complete the installation. Information here : https://dell.to/3kKQG3L Dell -Charles RSocial Media and Communities ProfessionalDell Technologies | Enterprise Support ServicesDid I answer your query?

345,"Hi, just bough a 2nd hand T630. The support states that Server 2019 is supported. Im trying to install the OS now and via the Lifecycle Controller. Server 2019 isnt shown as a supported OS for install. Okay, so ill just boot from the ISO and install - cant as Im not then able to find drivers for the Perc 730p to see the Virtual Disk. Ive updated the iDRAC to the latest version in the hope that might help, but no. I can only find drivers for Server 2016, but 2019 is shown as supported. Please can someone point me in the right direction? Thank you..","Hi, Yes, T630 does seem to support Windows Server 2019 referring to this guide: https://dell.to/3nlhZ2K. Though, the RAID Controller H730P does not support the OS referring to the user guide https://dell.to/2JVd8rk, that may be the reason you're not able to find the drivers for Windows Server 2019. Let me know if you have any questions. DELL-Joey CSocial Media and Communities ProfessionalDell Technologies | Enterprise Support ServicesDid I answer your query?

435,HiTwo dell servers; Windows Server 2016 Standard DC (PE T440) and Windows Server 2012 R2 Standard member server.We have a peculiar networking issue. We started getting network connection issues. This happens for a few seconds and at no particular interval but let’s say once every one to two hours.Here is what we noticed;On member server the RWW connection will break for a few seconds and then restored.However we also get MS Access database crashes which complains that network connection was lost and to restart db to continue. The MS Access database was running from a shared folder on the DC. We moved the db to a shared folder on the member server but MS Access database still crashed.We moved both DC and member servers to a different switch. No luck. We reinstalled Windows Server 2016 standard on DC and moved back MS Access database to a shared folder on DC but still no luck and MS Access database still crashes.Could all this be due to DC hardware networking issues such as faulty network card or network cabling connecting DC to switch? At this point I am considering changing both DC’s network card and cable.Is there something someone can suggest to home in on this issue?ThanksRegards.,"Hi, that's really some peculiar issue I guess. The fact that the problem is happening from time to time and not in a certain pattern made me think that the problem was not caused by the server. Here I will suggest you to update NIC drivers and firmware. https://dell.to/3pQOyst If there is no error in the SEL log then I would think that it is more likely to be caused by DC networking. For example, I think it might even be the cables. Please update here on how it goes!Thanks,Erman ÖzkurtSocial Media and Communities Professional Dell Technologies | Enterprise Support Services Did I answer your query?

569,"Hello,So, i have an R720XD server and im trying to get 768GB RAM Memory (24x32GB) and, when i put 16x32 memory, its everything okay, server telling me I have 512GB RAM Memory, but when i start added another rams, to the ""Green slots"" amount of ram start goes to random (386GB/256GB) and i just cant get more than 512GB ram, i use 2xE5-2690v2, bios is the nevest (2.9.0) and memory what i use is all 24 pieces of 32GB 4Rx4 PC3L-10600R-9-12-AB0. HMT84GR7MMR4A - H9 D8 AG . Any ideas why? Of course idrac didnt post any troubles, but im getting message from start. That ""Warning: The number of ranks on this device is not supported."" So, how can i get 768GB Ram when 32GB memory stick have 4Rx4 or 4Rx8 ?.","It looks like the DIMMs you're using are RDIMMs and not LRDIMMs. All the DIMMs I'm seeing for this capacity are LRDIMMs. The manual indicates that 16GB RDIMMs are not supported, so I would suspect that 32GB RDIMMs would not be, either. I would use the 768GB config from the sample document page. The only difference I see is the use of LRDIMMs, as opposed to LRDIMMs.  R720XD Manual (sample memory config page) https://dell.to/3vKbuLT If you don't mind sharing a SupportAssist collection form the iDRAC, you're welcome to PM me.

559,"Hi guysI'm having trouble with two redundants PSUs on a R820 server.When both PSUs are connected, a green light is blinking on PSU2. When a single PSU is connected (regardless of slot), the green light does not flash and no alarm on the IDRAC is detected.Accessing IDRAC the psu alarms configuration error. Also tried to access the lifecycle controller but found no firmware update for any of the PSUs.

564,"I have a PowerEdge R620 with a few disk groups. One of which is consists of two degraded virtual disks. Four physical disks are used to form the virtual disks, but one of the drives is shown on BIOS as missing regardless of whether the failed drive or the new drive with the same part number is inserted. I read that the RAID is supposed to be setup with a Hot Spare for automatic drive rebuild, but I guess it wasn't setup that way. So I am wondering if there is really no way to resolve these two degraded virtual disks through the BIOS except through the use of a third party software. Thanks..","Hi, thanks for choosing Dell. If it is shown as foreign, you need to clear the foreign. Then when the disk turns ready, that’s when you can use hotspare. https://dell.to/3zyoO8f.DELL-Young ESocial Media and Communities ProfessionalDell Technologies | Enterprise Support ServicesDid I answer your query?

But if I install all four modules, or even just three (in A1, A2, A3) the server appears not to boot - it sits at ""Configuring memory, please wait.""

Install the power cables back and turn on the server. Check if the issue persist. If it does, remove all components except the below and turn on the server to check the issue. Try another monitor. If all fail, there is no other steps to restore the server, unfortunately, you need to replacement the mainboard.One power supplyCPU1 (minimum for troubleshooting)System boardHeat sink for CPU1 for prevention of overheatingOne DIMM for CPU 1Control panelControl-panel cableRiser card  DELL-Joey CSocial Media and Communities ProfessionalDell Technologies | Enterprise Support Services#Did I answer your query?

12,"Hi there,I've got a PowerEdge R320, great deal, £70 for an E5-2450, 48gb ram, dedicated enterprise iDRAC, both 350w PSU's and 3TB HDDs with a raid controller. However, I'm having lots of trouble when I'm running into updating the iDRAC firmware. I'm a bit of a neat freak so I'd really love everything to be as up-to-date as possible and I've gone through countless steps trying to fix this. Right now, It's on version 2.21.21. I haven't had any trouble updating the BIOS firmware but I have now rolled it back to its original 2.4.2 from having updated it to 2.9.0 . I have installed Windows Server 2012 R2 on it to try and get it to install from there but still no hope. I don't actually get that much of an error message when i do it, but its usually RED004. I've had a couple times where I've tried and the website comes up with iDRAC 8 instead of  iDRAC7. I have also tried hard resetting it with the command:racadm racreset hard -f Although this works to get iDRAC back into it's regular state after the firmware update going weird, trying again just gives similar errors and I have tried updating via the web page. This has been trying to upgrade to 2.30.30 and 2.65.65 I believe. Any help is much appreciated!.","Hi Joey,Today is the day it happened!I successfully updated the iDRAC firmware to 2.65.65.65 from 2.21.21.21.Firstly, I'd like to say thank you for your help in troubleshooting the situation and sticking with me throughout this nightmare.After having tried every method under the sun, iDRAC would still not update. Luckily, I found a great guy on YouTube (shoutout to him) going over his steps to fix a bricked iDRAC. Luckily, in my situation my iDRAC wasn't necessarily 'bricked'; iDRAC had no problem working even after the hundred failed firmware update attempts that I had tried. Although my situation wasn't exactly like his, the methods used to try and treat a bricked iDRAC managed to treat mine as well.So these are the steps I took to fix this problem (For an R320 or similar) Just to be said, I am not a qualified electrician. These are purely the steps I took to overcome this problem:You will need:USB UART device, one capable of 3.3v. (Cheap from Amazon)Soldering ironSD Card in the FAT format loaded with the firmware.d7 file in the root folder.iDRAC Enterprise cardSpare PC or Laptop with PuTTY installed.Make sure you export your iDRAC license. This can be done by the web GUI. If necessary also export you iDRAC settings as this will completely wipe all iDRAC configuration.On the motherboard there will be a BMC_UART port right next to the rear I/O of the MB. The connection pinout is: R320 (or similar) BMC_UARTFunctionPin 1 (Square Pad)Vdd (3.3v)Pin 2TxPin 3RxPin 4GNDSolder 4 jumper wires onto the board and connect them to the USB UART dongle as followed. Make sure the server is off!Connect to the serial port in PuTTY with your COM interface (if you're unsure what interface to use, check device manager) with a baudrate of 115200 using TELNET. Now you can boot the server. If those steps were successful, you should now see the uboot process of the server. If it has booted successfully, you should be greeted with a linux shell but in this situation we wont be needing that. Although it's a good idea to test your UART wiring so you are able to send text to the console.This next step can be a bit tricky. You now need a paperclip or anything else you can use to short a switch on the MB. The switch is located near the large silver heatsink, named SW2. To reboot the system, short switch 1. Now this is the tricky part - quickly switch over and short switch 2 while spamming any key in the console. If you are lucky, you will see the uboot process has been interrupted and you now have an iDRAC prompt. It will look something like: iDRAC 7/8=>With the FAT formatted SD card loaded with the fimware image, run: util recover -emmc -from sd -f firmimg.d7 -noreset -clean  If you are successful, it should have erased the EMMC and installed the new firmware. You can now unplug the server when it's safe to do so and drain the power by holding the power button down for 30 seconds. Unfortunately if you were unsuccessful, you may have a bad EMMC chip, I have read that these can go bad from perhaps too many write cycles.When booting up, you may or may not have the lifecycle controller telling you an update is required or spit out a firmware error. This is ok, just reboot the server a couple times and it should return to normal. Boot into the lifecycle controller and click 'about' in the top right corner. Voila! The iDRAC firmware should now be up-to-date! To restore the iDRAC license, go to the Platform Restore section and import the license. You will need a USB stick with your exported license on it. You can now unsolder the BMC_UART connection if you wish and uninstall the SD Card from the iDRAC Card.Here is a labelled photo of the MB to guide you: Here are the forums that helped me:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvSDNAi39YY&ab_channel=JunctionRunner https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/bsou3n/dell_r520_idrac_7_swc0700_and_idrac8_prompt/ https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/a49b4y/r720_idrac_help/ https://winraid.level1techs.com/t/problem-dell-r720xd-idrac-bios-recovery/32658/95 Many Thanks!","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvSDNAi39YY&ab_channel=JunctionRunner, https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/bsou3n/dell_r520_idrac_7_swc0700_and_idrac8_prompt/, https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/a49b4y/r720_idrac_help/, https://winraid.level1techs.com/t/problem-dell-r720xd-idrac-bios-recovery/32658/95",
